vegetarian,"Thanksgiving 2020 Discussion (US) Just about 2 weeks to go until Thanksgiving in the US. Things are going to be different this year for a lot of us due to the pandemic, so let's try to have one centralized discussion on the issue to make it easier to find. Feel free to ask questions, share ideas and recipes, post pictures of your meals, or anything else related to Thanksgiving. 

In our past discussions we've had a lot of great recipes shared (especially squash &amp; gravy), menu ideas, suggestions for substitutions, veggie loaves (both recipes and suggested brands) as well as some ranting about people in our lives who were less than thankful for our dietary restrictions. Not all of the issues are the same this year, but they're worth checking out anyways.

vegetarian,"Newbie question I'm thinking about cutting out meat altogether, but I've heard/read that my health will suffer because there are certain essential nutrients *only* found in meat/animal products. Vit B12 is the one most talked about, for example. How worried are you about this aspect of going meat-free? How important is it to supplement, and is it a drag?"
vegetarian,"Rennet! What else is not vegetarian?! So, I’ve been vegetarian for several months now and I just learned that some cheese is not naturally vegetarian. I literally had no idea that rennet was a thing, until I happened to look at the ingredients on some cheese I bought recently and it said “vegetarian rennet.” Of course, if it exists in a vegetarian form, that means it obviously exist in a non-vegetarian for him, so I looked it up and now I’m sad.

My deciding factor in what I eat is, “did an animal have to die for me to have this?” If the answer is no, I consider that food vegetarian and I eat it. If the answer is yes, I don’t. Pretty simple rules.

Anyway, my question is, is there anything else that people tend to think is vegetarian but isn’t? Is there something else I’ve been missing? Being vegetarian is important to me so I feel sad that I have missed this all along. I don’t want to continue making that mistake."

vegetarian,"Is anyone else here NOT planning on raising their kids veggie? I'd like to have kids in the next few years, and sometimes think about what I'd feed them. Though I hope they would someday choose to be vegetarian or vegan, it's not something I'm going to push on them.

I've never really believed that a vegetarian or vegan diet was the healthier choice. We do absorb many nutrients more easily from animal sources, particularly things like calcium that are extra important for kids. From a health perspective, it seems that a diet high in fruit and veg that also includes some animal products and chicken/fish is best. I gave up meat for ethical reasons, rather than because I was under any illusions that it would make me healthier (and it certainly hasn't).

I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be cooking meat for my kids. But my fiancé is an omni so I imagine I'd leave that to him. I would try and introduce them to tasty vegetarian meals, and hope that they might make the choice themselves someday. But we are naturally omnivores, and I would feel weird enforcing my ethics on them if I wasn't sure it was what was best for their health? I feel like the choice to give up meat would have to be their own.

Not trying to shame anyone who is or is intending to raise their kids veggie. Just wondering if any others aren't?"

vegetarian,"Non-Meat Fast food I have a feeling that most of the beyond meat products in the fast-food industry is aimed more towards people who eat meat, rather than vegetarians and vegans. Burger king uses the same broiler for the beyond burgers and regular burgers, KFC is frying their beyond chicken in the same fryer as regular chicken, and Pizza hut using the same meat scooper for beyond sausage and their other meats, etc. Beyond meat and other Non-Meat fast food products have become more of a novelty for people who eat meat rather than an option for vegetarians or vegans. I'm not a business major, but would it really be that expensive for the fast-food companies to set aside a separate workstation for vegetarian or vegan food? I have seen this in India where the vegetarian and meat aspects of food are made at separate work stations so why not do that here as well?"

vegetarian,"Family ate a dog Okay so i’ve been a vegetarian for only a half year and recently I kept remembering things from the past that includes animal, mostly the ones I regret. Back when I was a small kid, my family owned this one dog. He was an active dog and very friendly. He was a good dog except for his behaviour of chasing my neighbour’s chickens and I’m pretty sure he killed and ate some of those chickens. My family felt the need to give him away and I dont mean up for adoption. They literally planned to leave him on the street. I cried cause I really love dogs.
But then later I found out my uncle and his family somehow got that dog from my parents and cooked him. They fucking ate him! Which is fucking stupid and super crazy. They weren’t feeling guilty too. I confronted my parents, but they shrugged it off. I hated them for so long and now this memories came back and I feel angry again.
This may sound like some fake story but apparently its true and its not that uncommon for my culture. They don’t just eat livestock animals but also animals like snakes, bats and frogs :&lt; People should just die"

vegetarian,"What do you like to bring for barbeques? I've been a vegetarian for many years now yet I can't figure out anything fun to bring for grill parties with friends.  I'm quite jealous of meat eating friends that can just rip out a steak or sausage from the plastic pack and throw on the grill without having to prep with spices, toppings etc. When I go to a party I want to drink and relax rather than mash chickpeas into patties and chopping vegetables.

I usually bring the same shit each time: halloumi, garlic bread, corn, pineapple and stuffed mushrooms. It's good, but it's repetetive and have started to bore me in the long run. I barely look forward to grill parties for this reason, sometimes I even consider to just ordering food delivery instead of bringing food to grill.

Some things I already tried but didn't enjoy:

&amp;#x200B;

* Soy sausages and burger patties (too bland)
* Veggies such as potatoes, aubergine, squash (Too much prepping needed to make them tasty, too bland and boring without any prep.)
* Pizzas and wraps lol (Tasty but I just don't want to spend valuable party time with chopping up sandwich ingredients to put on bread)

As you may notice I'm not a vegetarian for health reasons so anything that's unhealthily tasty is preferred. Bonus points for cheesy, creamy, fatty and salty things to grill.

vegetarian,"Beyond beef gone bad taste? I’m new to being vegetarian and I thought I would try beyond beef for the first time, only... this tastes terrible. It reminds me of nail polish remover. I thought it might just smell bad and taste great (I liked beyond sausage) so I tried just sautéing it with onions and carrots for longer and thought maybe that might make it go away, but it tastes so bad. I added tomatoes and spices to let it simmer (making a Chili) and it’s so overpowering. Is this just what is tastes like? 

Sorry for the question, I just don’t want to waste all my ingredients before I add beans or toss it, and since this is my first time with this, just wanna make sure."
vegetarian,"Soy alternatives? I really enjoy tofu, and it is my protein of choice. However, I am currently breastfeeding my infant daughter and, with her pediatrician, we have determined that she may be sensitive to soy. While many of our recipes can be adapted to be soy/tofu-free, we cook a lot of Chinese, Korean, and Thai recipes. Does anyone have recommendations for substitutions for tofu (and soy sauce) in these recipes? 

We have tried seitan in the past but it is very expensive where we are ($6-$8 for an 8oz package). So it's an option, but not one we can use frequently.

We'd also welcome your soy-free recipe recommendations!"
vegetarian,"How can I get enough calories? A few years ago I lost 80 pounds.  While I still had chicken breasts almost daily for dinner, I ate salads and fat free yogurts for virtually every lunch and breakfast for a year.

Recently I started putting weight back on so I decided to refocus on what worked.  Well much to my surprise the place I get salads from now has specific calorie info.  Turns out I was eating about 85 calories a day at lunch for a full year and combined with my yogurt wasn’t even getting to 200 before dinner each day.  I was starving myself.

Anyway, how do full on vegetarians get their daily calories?  I really don’t want to put butter on healthy meals when I’d rather just eat a taco.  

I’ll never go full vegetarian but I could definitely use a few tips on how I could manage a mostly vegetarian diet without starving myself."

Most herbs/spices seem ok apparently.  I'm considering making a pasta with chickpea sauce but need inspiration for an alternative or some good side dishes to go with it.  Ideas please!

vegetarian,"Just a friendly PSA about rennet! Hi there, long time lurker, first time poster.  
I have seen some posts in the few years I've been on here, where people mention eating certain cheeses like parmesan or gruyere or what have you. I just wanted to say that some cheeses aren't vegetarian because they contain rennet (an enzyme found in the stomach lining of calves and goats). Obviously it's a personal choice what you put in your body, but I just wanted to sort of let people know about rennet just in case they weren't already aware! (And also in case this would matter to them). After doing a little reading I found that the following cheeses traditionally are made with rennet:  
Parmesan  
Manchego  
Emmenthaler  
Gruyere  
Grana Padano  
Pecorino Romano  
Gorgonzola  
Most softer cheeses generally don't have any rennet in them though! I was vegetarian for years before I heard about this! Good luck on your veggie journeys! Also, sorry if you guys are already well aware!"

vegetarian,"How to get rid of ""grain + meat = meal"" mindset? I grew up in a place where a main meal is a grain/starch + meat. Think potatoes and meatballs, pasta and mince beef, boiled potatoes and fish, rice and chicken... If it was really adventurous, there might have been some overcooked peas or baby carrots as a side.

In times when I'm hungry and out of ideas, this is the kind of food I gravitate towards, out of convenience and familiarity. Except it doesn't really work on a vegetarian diet. I've tried some meat replacement products, but they're generally pretty expensive here, and hit or miss as for taste and texture.

How do I get rid of this mindset, and learn to broaden my thinking when it comes to the structure of a balanced meal? I typically eat things like veggie soups, lentil bolognese, chickpea curry, fried rice and veggies, quinoa salad... But sometimes it feels like all I'm eating is meals I can shovel into my mouth from a bowl. Honestly can't even remember last time I used a fork and a knife to eat, it's all just spoons spoons spoons lol. Absolutely perfect pretty often, but sometimes I miss having all those distinctly different components.

Also I tried to look at the FAQ and beginner questions, but can't seem to get to them on mobile, so apologies if this has been asked a million times already."

vegetarian,"My (formerly omnivore) body decided meat is a repulsive, revolting, non-food item, but my brain hasn't caught up yet. Anyone else experienced this? Life long omnivore, decided to increase the percentage of vegetarian and vegan meals about a year ago. This was for my health, for sustainability reasons, and also because I don't want to support the practices in the meat industry. 

About two months ago my body started to find meat revolting even though my mind still occasionally wanted it. Two examples: I had just started eating a chicken curry and despite it tasting good, suddenly the texture made me feel really sick to my stomach and I had to spit it out. Another time I was heating up a moroccan chicken soup and my nose thought it smelled nice, but without even tasting any I felt so nauseated that my mouth started filling up with saliva and I had to camp out in the bathroom for 5 min in case I threw up (I was totally fine after making something without meat). There are a couple of other examples too, and it has happened 100% of the time I've attempted to eat meat in the last couple of months. I also feel a little physically uneasy about dairy and eggs, although I still consume both sometimes. With dairy and eggs it's like I have to make a conscious effort not to think about what they are. 

I'm not squeamish about blood, I have no problem watching surgery, I've always been up for trying any food no matter how 'gross,' and I have cooked chicken for my sick cat three times in the last month without it being an issue. My conscious, rational brain does not find meat or flesh to be disgusting, although as I said above I had already decided that slowly reducing and ultimately eliminating my meat consumption was the way forward. And yet...

Has anyone else experienced this? I did some googling and the top suggestion was pregnancy (I'm not pregnant - I checked), with the second being a meat allergy caused by a tick bite. Obviously it's not an allergy if I react without eating any. I mean I'm not complaining; it's like I got an awesome cheat code and levelled up without any effort. But it's just really weird?"

I went back to the same shop to make sure that this wasn't simply my stupid mistake. I was certain they were in the ""Now Vegan Friendly"" store box. They were. I asked management why this was the case and they took the non-vegan ones out of the box and took the box away.

I recently adopted a vegetarian diet and about once every 1-2 weeks now I am having really bad diarrhea, belching (that tastes/smells awful), bloating, nausea, and abdominal pain that lasts for about 2 days. Did any of you experience this when you started on a healthier diet? I'm wondering if these symptoms could possibly be due to increased fiber intake. I literally don't know how I'm not just floating away due to all the gas. It's awful. I've never had burps like these before. Worse, I now associate those horrible things with the new dishes I'm eating and then never want to make them again! 

I did download a diet tracker app today to help identify the cause of these symptoms. I guess it's just really discouraging to have so much pain and discomfort from trying to eat healthier."

vegetarian,"Ex Vegans, how do you make peace with your ethical concerns around dairy and eggs? I guess I’m an ex vegan now. I’ve been vegan or vegetarian for a lot of my adult life, switching back and forth and even going back to meat multiple times. 

This time, I went vegan because my husbands cholesterol was out of control and my daughter is allergic to dairy and eggs. While I enjoy it, it really limits our options and I am having trouble cooking giant meals for a family of 5 using only plant based foods and I find myself eating way too much vegan junk. I also felt like I was inconveniencing loved ones when they wanted to have a meal with us and I believe community with other humans is more important than one non vegan meal here and there. 

With all of that in mind, I decided we will stay 90% plant based at home with the addition of occasional fish and some treats like parmesan cheese or chocolate, but we will only be pescatarian when ordering food or eating at someone’s home. 

Since my daughter is allergic to dairy and eggs, I’ll still be buying non dairy cheese and milk, and we don’t have eggs often anyways. Also my husband still needs to watch his cholesterol. 

Anyways, I digress. How do you deal with the guilt of eating dairy and eggs? Do you just tell yourself that you are making a difference even if it’s less than when you were vegan? Do you strictly buy from local farmers? I feel like such a massive hypocrite but I genuinely cannot be strictly vegan anymore.

I do like tofu and a certain type of vegeterian burger for example, but I think that relying on ""fake meats"" and things that are trying to be similar to meat (yea I know tofu doesn't have to be that) would be a great way to set myself up for failure. I wanna be satisfied with food that just happens to not have meat in it, I don't want to have the worse versions of all the food I love for the rest of my life.

Is there anyone here who has gone through something similar when starting out? I've noticed I really like food that's full of fats and protein (and I don't have weight issues so it's fine), and that might be part of the reason for me only really being satisfied with food with meat usually. Is it possible for me to find a diet that I'll be truly happy with as a vegeterian?

I'd love some recommendations for food to try out, perhaps not even for actually trying it out but just to feel like I'd have a lot of good options."
vegetarian,"Significant improvements in my mental health? Hey all you beautiful people,

I've dedicated this year to growing and becoming a better person, and as the result of a confluence of things, I've gone back to vegetarianism after 2 years doing omnivorous keto - I cant stand the taste or smell of meat anymore, and I feel bad eating dead things, so vegetarian is my option lol. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, except for, in retrospect, when I was a vegetarian as a young adult. I've been vegetarian again for 4 days now and it's like a cloud has lifted from my soul: I'm happier, less anxious, have more energy, think more clearly, and I'm able to shake off aggressive, negative thought trains way more easily. My other self care and lifestyle routines haven't changed. 


Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it last? 

Thanks!"

Are there any meals / meal plans that have a good amount of protein in? Possibly over the daily recommended intake, I think I'm at the maintence point cause I've not been losing any weight since becoming veggie."

I went vegetarian when I was 8, then vegan at 17. I’m 27 now and still vegan. It’s something I honestly thought I would take to my grave because I felt and feel so passionately about animal rights and knowing where your food is grown. 

But then.... I got chickens. 

I have two beautiful hens. I got them in July as day old chicks, which means they’re 22 weeks old now. This means any day now, I could have fresh eggs. 

When I first got them I had no interest in their future eggs. I assumed I would give them to neighbors or drop them off in my local community fridge. The more I care for them and spend time with them, though, the more I want to eat their eggs. 

SO I WILL, GOD DAMMIT.

When I moved to Texas I was incarcerated and even put on suicide watch for a week. I didn't crack the whole time eating nothing but oranges, bread and the desert throwing away whatever uhhh the meat is.

So I was eventually told they were going to keep me in the suicide watch room unless I went three days eating the sandwiches. I caved. And did so the remainder of my six months. It did take me a while to go back to vegetarian, and had to make the stop when I moved to a food scarce area with not many options.

Fast forward to now, vegetarian again for five months and vegan for two weeks! You can do the thing, I believe in you"

For meat toppings we use a designated measuring cup to pour all meats onto the pizzas.

We are a family that doesn't eat a lot of meat, and no red meat at all.  My 8 year old son has stated that he no longer wants to eat animals, and I support him in that, but there are a few issues that I am concerned about.

1.  Even on a meat inclusive diet he has a very low BMI/ weight to age percentage.  He was in the 8th percentile at his last check-up and the doctor said we need to watch his weight.  He also is in the 80th percentile for height, so he's like a bean pole.
2. He can be picky and I don't know if he would like tofu or other classic meat substitutes.
3. Will he get sufficient calories from a plant based diet to help him gain weight, not just maintain.

I guess what I'm asking for are some calorie dense recipes for meals and snacks, and protein rich sources for main dishes.  Thank you for any help!"

To that group in class: I don't care if I'm rude for interrupting your group conversation. You're in class. It's not a private space. And you're shitting on vegetarians,  saying that we're dumb? ""Doing it for the environment is stupid. What   car does \[vegetarian\] drive? Do they use coal?""

Also, look around. You're complaining that a vegetarian drives, but fail to realize that this crappy Midwestern town *has no public transportation system*. What the fuck else are we supposed to do, walk 3 miles to school in freezing weather?

It was in little slightly fibrous curls, a little springy on the tooth, and although it was hard to tell from the sauce staining it, I would say it was probably off-white when not doused in turmeric. The flavour was also masked by the sauce but seemed to be pretty neutral, but the texture was much firmer and more cohesive than tofu.

vegetarian,"Vegetarian Stews / Curries? Help an Omnivore out Hiya, let's start off by saying I am not, and will probably never be, a vegetarian. However my girlfriend is. We have been living together for about 2 years and it's generally fine, some night I just eat a piece of meat and she eats some veggie sausage. Some nights we cook a pasta/rice dish and I just make some chicken/bacon to go with it. We eat casseroles quite often, in that case I make 2, one with meat and one without (or with lentils or something). 

And of course it also occurs that I eat vegetarian, I think that's the case about 3 times a week or so, sometimes because she doesn't know what meat to make with something. Sometimes because I myself am too lazy to cook in two seperate pans, sometimes because the meat is in the dish only because western quisine kinda demands it to be, but it adds literally nothing to the flavour (theres so much flavourless minced meat in dishes without making any sense). 

I've tried to find more recipes that can work for us both. Things like [www.kitchentreaty.com](https://www.kitchentreaty.com) from time to time, these kind of websites help, however they are usually vegetarian dishes to which one can 'add some cooked chicken', 'shred through some bacon', 'make a steak on the side'. Sadly these things don't really exist the other way around. From a vegetarian standpoint this might be a solution, but it's simply not as satisfactory as a meat dish and usually very clear it's an afterthought. And cooking a 'regular' meal and just leaving out the meat for her tends to result in very bland dishes. 

The issue is, my favourite foods are stews, and not some chickpea thing (though those can be good), but a full on meat based stew. From beef Bourguinon to Rendang and from a chicken pot pie to chicken masala. And if there is one thing I love to do on my sundays it's to start off my slow simmering meat before lunch and spend all day on making an amazing stew. 

Two problems arise with this:  
1.  a veggie stew just cannot hold up to this in my eyes (and yes I have tried).   
2.  spending all day on a meat stew and eating it 'by myself' while she eats some random veggie food just isn't as enjoyable/fullfilling as sharing it with meat eaters. 

So what I am looking for is basically vegetarian stew/curry recipes I can make alongside my favourites on sundays, and possibly a good source for recipes of my favourite meat meals, but turned veggie. I've tried discussing these things with her of course, but she isn't much of a cook and doesn't really enjoy cooking, thus doesn't really know either."

vegetarian,"Spinach/Kale replacement? Hi, looking for a bit of advice.

I've been trying to change my diet up after a lifetime of nothing but meat. Thankfully, it turns out I really, really like veg! Between veggies, feta and halloumi I seriously don't miss meat at all. My body also feels a lot better than it used to in pretty much every way.

I try to keep carbs low, so I'm making a lot of stir-fry with kale and/or spinach as the base. I've found out spinach and kale are two of my favourite foods - seriously, I can stir-fry a pound of either and happily eat and eat. 

I was thinking spinach and kale are the perfect foods - cheap, healthy, delicious. But when researching, apparently it's dangerous to eat a lot of either every day. Something about oxalates, there may be other dangers. I really don't know too much about it because it's all new to me, but it's a crying shame. I'd happily eat both all the time!

Is there another vegetable I can use as a base for my stir-frys that I can eat every day? Or just switch up with spinach/kale to cut down on any potential dangers? I'm open to most suggestions but should point out that I can't stand potatoes or sprouts, also I'm looking for something low carb if possible.

Big thanks to anyone willing to offer advice because I want to continue with this, it makes me feel great. I don't want to live on burgers anymore!"

vegetarian,"I've been vegetarian all my life, and just got my hands on some Impossible. How can I prepare it, and what can I do with it? As the title says, my (extended) family and I are *hereditary* vegetarians, and we have never prepared even meat substitutes at home, including seitan and TVP (tofu is occasional). 99% of the food I make and eat is *completely* vegetable- and dairy-based, so I have no idea how meat preparation even works. 

Anyway. we have recently gotten our hands on some frozen Impossible at the nearby supermarket (thanks for bringing it to Singapore, Impossible). I *have* eaten Impossible burgers at restaurants, of course, but I'm still unsure how to prepare it off the freezer, because it looks and feels so meaty. What can I do with it? I've considered spaghetti bolognese or meatball spaghetti, or maybe some 'steak', but how? Do you have any suggestions? 

N.B. I'm OK with the taste of Impossible: it's... different, but not altogether unpalatable."

I love Beyond burgers, but they have a unique taste to them. Like other veggy burgers, I never really thought of them as a beef analog, which was always fine to me. Veggy burgers were just their own unique thing. The Impossible ones though... I don't think I would have been able to tell them from beef. I'm pretty sure I can happily serve these to people who do want to pretend their veggy burgers are beef.

Anyway, just throwing it out there that I think it's amazing how far vegan substitutes have come in recent years."

vegetarian,"I woke up this morning and had an idea for mushroom patties for breakfast and they turned out amazing. Figured I'd share and jot down a recipe before I forget. First I started with a 6oz jar of mushrooms, stems and pieces. Two bowls. I drained the mushrooms and patted dry with paper towels to remove moisture. Then I finely chopped them and move them to the other bowl. Once I was done there I added salt and spices to the empty bowl, touch of oil like a paste rub, and then added the minced mushrooms to the mixture along with one large egg, instant mash, toss and stir until everything is coated. Then I added the 1 cup flour and mixed to make a sticky dough. Meanwhile a pan has been preheated with hot oil. Form the dough balls or patties and fry until crispy brown, flip and repeat, flip once more if needed. Lay finished patty on paper towel to soak up oil. I ate mine with ketchup, deeply reminded me of meatloaf.

If I did this again I might have refrigerate 30 minutes to let the dough stiffen up, and also perhaps do a bread crumb coating.

- 1 jar mushrooms, drained, patted dry

- 1 large egg

- 1/2 tsp baking soda

- 3/4 or half tsp salt

- 1/2 tsp black pepper

- 1 tsp onion powder

- 1 tsp basil

- 1 tsp parsley

- 3 tsp LaChoy soy sauce

- 1/4 cup instant mash potatoes flakes

- 1 cup flour

If you try it let me know how it turns out. Recipe as best as I can remember as I'd just woke up and was winging it."

So I’m heavily considering doing this master’s program in plant biotechnology research. Everything else about the program is awesome, but there’s one issue: the ultimate goal of the project is to genetically engineer a particular crop that’s used as cattle feed. 

Here are some reasons why I’m still considering it:

1. The main reason I am vegetarian is for environmental reasons. By improving the efficiency of a crop used as animal feed, I’d actually be contributing to making the meat industry ever so slightly more environmentally friendly. 

2. No animals will be harmed directly in my research. I’m only working with plants. 

3. This program will equip me with the skills and experience I’ll need to do future research that I hope will help make plant based diets more sustainable

4. There is a low probability of my research during this program being significant enough to actually help the meat industry directly.

I (23F) have been vegan for 1.5 years, vegetarian for 7 years prior to that. I went vegan because of environmental and ethical reasons. However, as of recently, I have been thinking about switching back to being a vegetarian for a few reasons: 1) I have a history of anorexia and have found the restrictiveness of the vegan diet really bad for my mental health. 2) I feel like vegan ""junk food"" products, like vegan cheese, are worse for the environment than more locally-made regular cheeses (I'm located in the midwest of the US). 3) I feel like, as a vegan, it's much harder to participate in events with food involved. If my friends are having pizza, it's no fun to not be able to join them. I also dislike having all of my friends' choices of restaurants and whatnot be determined by whether or not they have vegan options. 

That being said, I feel SO BAD about even thinking about eating dairy. I'm not interested in eating eggs and I would still eat like 70-90% vegan, but it's so difficult to deal with the anxiety and guilt around eating dairy a small number of times per week. I also know that my stomach will be totally wrecked from eating dairy lol. Have any of y'all dealt with going from vegan to vegetarian?

To best illustrate the point, I'll give a couple of examples of my regular meals at the moment which I still sometimes find hard to do:

Spag bol - cook 500g mince, add jar of sauce sauce, simmer, cook pasta, combine, done - good for 3-4 meals.

Ravioli (can easily make this vege) - fry packet of sliced mushrooms in garlic paste, cook ravioli, add spinach to mushrooms, combine, add jar of sauce, done - good for 2-3 meals

Japanese curry (most complicated one I do) - dice chicken, potatos, carrots, onions, cook on stove for 5 minutes, add water, simmer for 15, cook rice, add curry blocks to pot, wait 5 minutes, done - good for 4 meals.

vegetarian,I ate meat I had pizza today and it was super thick cheese with the pepperoni completely hidden under it. According to my family it was cheese and I was so hungry I began gobbling it down. As I got a few bites in I noticed the pepperoni. I instantly began to break down and tried to make myself throw up but couldn’t. I feel like shit. I don’t know what to do bc I feel disgusting.
vegetarian,"A little stuck... Hi guys, this is my first post in this subreddit. I’ve been vegetarian for 3 ish years. (Since Mother’s Day 2017)
For a long time, in order to get myself to be vegetarian I was very anti meat, I would constantly say to myself ewe meat and stuff like that. So for a long time I saw meat as this horrible thing even though I’ve grown up eating it. I actually never thought I’d be vegetarian, you know those conversations you have with vegetarians like ‘oh I could never do that’. 

Anyway, as of late a lot of my families comments have been starting to bother me again, things like I’m so difficult to buy for and to feed. When all you do is cook meat and veg like normal except I don’t have the meat lol. I don’t care if someone eats meat in front of me or whatever, I just prefer my stuff is cooked seperate (like don’t cook bacon and then eggs in the same pan if it isn’t washed) 

Another thing is that i eat beef flavouring with noodles ( I had checked years ago and there’s no actual beef in the ones I use) and my family likes to make comments on that, same with chicken salt but this is because most shops don’t ask what salt, they just chuck the chicken salt on. Like even though they aren’t vegetarian they are judging me for not being a perfect vegetarian. It’s really frustrating. 

I’ve also had some pretty serious thoughts about going back to eating meat, deep down I know that I won’t because I’d feel like a failure. I feel horrible just thinking it.

So I was just curious how you guys deal with the constant snipes at you for being a vegetarian and any meat cravings you might have. 

Also I really need a good butter chicken recipe (obviously without the chicken) I’ve never had tofu though and beans aren’t really my thing haha so preferably recipes without those!

vegetarian,"Recipes with mushrooms in them Hi, please don’t come at me but I’ve not been really fond of mushrooms since I was young. I’d pick them out of pizzas and used to be all like “ew fungus”. Fast forward to now, I still feel weird about eating them, minus the very strong hatred I had. So for example if they’re sliced in a stir fry noodles situation, I’ll try and eat them unless they’re too big. Same with pizzas. However, I want to cook with them because I’m trying to eat healthier and honestly mushrooms would be a great addition. I need new recipes/ ideas that aren’t too mushroom focused like a mushroom risotto or soup or something, but rather like noodles where there are other vegetables to balance it out. What other ideas do you guys have? All recipes are welcome, thanks!!!

I've also been on a vegetarian diet for 8 months (mostly WFPB especially vegetables, beans and legumes, mushrooms, and tofu). I've been happy eating this way, losing weight while having energy for my workouts. However, in the past few days, I've suddenly become highly repelled by all foods, including things I used to enjoy. I wondered if I was craving for meats or junk food, but I was disgusted by the idea of those foods too. The only foods I can stomach now are corn and pumpkin. I'm guessing I could be tired of food restriction somehow (be it in terms of quantity of type of food), yet there isn't anything I'm craving. Or maybe it's a sign of poor mental health (I cycle through episodes of depression, and the pandemic is of course not making things any easier). Has anyone ever had this experience?

vegetarian,"A very simple question? If I was to eat one meal of whole foods what would be the healthiest combination.

For example:

1.  Oatmeal with ground flax seed for lots of minerals and ALA.  Two eggs scrambled for B-Vitamins.  Banana, Apple, Orange in oatmeal for some vitamin c and fiber, walnuts and almonds for some protein, bit of spinach for vitamin k.

Obviously some of you know a lot more so could put together a on meal thing that literally covers everything.

vegetarian,"Neighbor gifted me a case of high grade albacore tuna, and I don’t want to be rude. Hello, first time posting here. Ive been vegetarian for 9-10 months now, and my wife is also vegetarian/occasional pescatarian. I don’t eat fish/shellfish when she does because I don’t see it that different from meat. 

My next door neighbor has always been super generous to my kids and I, often giving us cases of snacks for the kids or a case of beer for the wife and I. Their dogs are show dogs and they often get gifts from sponsors that they share with us. 

Yesterday they gifted us 2 cases of high quality albacore tuna, which we accepted. It was the polite thing to do and my wife and one of my kids will still eat fish. We are also low-income, so I’m not inclined to refuse gifts. 

My concern is, I know my wife will eat it, but she wants to make full meals, like tuna casserole. I’m not sensitive to meat or anything where eating it will make me ill, but I’m struggling morally to decide if I should eat it or not. A case of food is a huge boon in my house and I don’t want to look a gift horse in the mouth. However, the reasons I went vegetarian are because I discovered human anatomy was not made for meat, and learning the amount of damage the slaughterhouses and livestock farms do to the land and the communities around them. I’m also not fond of the wholesale slaughter of animals, it should only be used when the animal is endangering the ecology. 

So I can’t decide now, do I eat this gift of tuna or not?"

I think my success is my change in mindset. It’s not about food I can’t have its food I choose not to have. It also doesn’t hurt that I’ve also lost 15 lbs! And I didn’t do anything else. 
However, my favorite holiday (Thanksgiving) is coming up and I feeling pretty anxious about it. For starters, I usually spend the holidays with my best friend and her family. My family is very terrible and I avoid them at all costs. But due to distance, work schedules, COVID, etc I haven’t been around them. They don’t even know I’ve gone vegetarian. I don’t want to be a burden to her and I don’t want to be rude by refusing food. She always works very hard on a great meal every year. I figured I could make a dish or two and bring it with me. But I’m not sure what to make for the whole family that would be vegetarian but would appeal to them (especially her children).  Any advice and/or recipes are appreciated."

While it's marinating, toast a bagel, spread on cream cheese, and add some capers and spinach. You can also add very thinly sliced onion but I didn't because I'm mildly allergic. Last, add the smoky tomato slices and enjoy!"

I've been strictly vegetarian for about 5 years now, but this year I began eating fish a couple times a month. Usually 1-3 times. I never really liked fish, but as I'm getting older I've found I don't mind some meals. 

The thing is, I don't know whether to tell people I'm vegetarian or pescatarian because generally I do not want to be served fish - I want vegetarian foods. Sometimes it just feels like a chore explaining to people my diet, when fish really only makes up a tiny amount sometimes.

vegetarian,"A mushroom trip turned me vegetarian and I lost 25 pounds so far... I should have done this a long time ago. It's in line with my values. But there's been so much going on in my life I just didn't feel I was at the place where diet was my priority.
     
Well I've flipped that on its head. I've adopted the perspective that diet should be one of my fundamental priorities. Which I could see before, I just didn't own it and live up to it.
     
After taking some psilocybin mushrooms a couple months ago everything clicked. After tripping, when I was coming down but still in that psychedelic headspace, I really needed to eat some food but all I had was a cheap frozen pizza. I cooked the bastard and sat down at the table to eat it. And it was so... pathetic. A sad sort of object to be fueling my body with. I was sensitive to its artificial taste and nature as a mass produced, preserved convenience food. It sort of depressed me and disgusted me to eat it. Mind you, I had been eating this stuff on the daily for **years**.
    
At that point I resolved to eat better in general, but didn't plan to cut out meat necessarily. But within the next day or two I had some chicken and experienced this sensation and flavor, whether imagined or not, that I was eating a corpse. It tasted like death. I was kind of mortified by it and in that moment it was obvious to me I should try being a vegetarian. 
    
Which has turned out great! I am addicted to burritos now. I always liked mexican food. I've found with mexican flavors I really don't miss or desire meat at all. A burrito with rice, beans, guacamole and other stuff is incredibly filling. I'm eating two fat ass burritos per day and that's about it. I'm always full and satisfied. And those burritos are something I really enjoy and look forward to each day. I'm a habitual eater so this makes sense for me. And like I said I've lost 25 pounds so far. Not eating meat basically bars me from a lot of the junky fast food and convenience food I turned to before.
    
Anyway. Just wanted to share. Cheers!"

vegetarian,"I've been a vegetarian for over a year for environmental reasons but now I'm rethinking everything Hello!

As the title says, I cut out meat for environmental reasons and to lower my carbon footprint. I gave up red meat 3 years ago and August 17, 2019, was the last time I ate any meat.

However, I have recently started learning about holistic land management and using cows and chickens to actively sequester carbon, build soil, and reduce emissions. I felt a strong moral obligation to remove meat because it was bad for the environment, but since I still feel a strong moral obligation to do what is best for the environment, I'm considering buying and eating meat again in order to support these beneficial practices.

I live in a rural state and I would be selective about which meat I buy; only producers who manage specifically to sequester carbon. Additionally, I could support my local economy. I'm definitely feeling some cognitive dissonance here. Does anybody have advice or insight?"

I’m really trying to embrace a plant based diet. I’m in a good mindset and of the sentiment where I’m desiring to eat plant based and haven’t been eating meat at dinners out, not buying meat at the grocery store, etc. It’s feeling really natural, which is awesome! Deep down in my heart I’ve been leaning towards this for a while, but the meat eating lifestyle is so easy and natural. I can cook meals with meat quite well. I love cooking for friends and family and it’s always great. 

This is where it goes south. Every time I try to cook something at home, it’s practically inedible. I was perusing the aisles of my cupboard and decided to make this whole grain rice I have. Cool. Sweet. Here we go. So I use some veg broth and get some rice going.. k, vegetable time. Looking in the fridge. Tomatoes. Asparagus. Okay. I can do this. So toss a little olive oil in the pan and cook the living shit out of a bunch of tomatoes.. throw the asparagus in there for a couple mins so it’s not mushy. Done deal. This is going to be awesome! Little salt! Sure! No probs!

So rice on plate, tomato abomination on top. Cool. Using the stuff in my fridge. Wicked. 

Fucking atrocious. Practically inedible. Tried some soy sauce. Did NOT save the day. I ate it. Begrudgingly. Grumbling about needing a cookbook or a trip down the spice aisle or sooooomething.

What do you guys keep in your fridge? How do I cook food I want to eat and not cry myself to sleep after? What are healthy staples to keep around? Every time
I go to a vegan or veg restaurant everything I eat is so delicious and I just make total shite every single time. Help.

It's my personal favorite recipe I've made that is vegetarian, and I'm proud of it.  I'm trying a few things to make it vegan as well.   I'm looking forward to finding and making new vegan recipes, as I love to cook and this will be a nice challenge to further my skills.  


In case you want to know the meal, it is meant to be fairly quick and easy, and I know there are things you could do to make it better.  I also eyeball the quantities.  But I finely dice potato and sautee it with salt/pepper.  Once it's starting to get a little color, I add a healthy amount of yellow onion and about 20 cashews or so, maybe 3/4 of the amount of potato.  Once those are nearly done cooking, I add a clove of garlic or two, maybe a half teaspoon of chili powder and cumin, sautee just a little more.  I put sour cream (the one thing not vegan yet) on a tortilla, the potato mixture, and lettuce with some almond cheese on top and Tapatio hot sauce.  


I have weird taste, but I think this is really good and I actually crave it and I'm excited about it.  Other than the sour cream, if you know of anything in here that isn't actually vegan like I think it is, let me know.  Since I'm new and still pushing myself to veganism, I'll take all the help I can get.  Also, sorry for the lack of quantities."

If it's Chik-fil-A I usually get stuck with fruit, but at least she brings something vegetarian. COVID happened, and I worked remotely for a few months. She knew I wasn't in the office, so vegetarian options weren't purchased for breakfast. Now I'm back at work, and there haven't been many vegetarian options recently since I don't know if she knows I'm in-office. 

Today was breakfast burritos. Before the receptionist sent an email to the building that breakfast was available, I went to look at the selection: only bacon and sausage. (It's a good idea for me to jump on breakfast before anyone else gets to it so I can snag the vegetarian option.) I wrote her an email asking for vegetarian options next time, and she said that cheese was sent over to our building. I am doubtful of that since I got to the breakfast before the receptionist sent the email that breakfast was ready.* Someone may have jumped on cheese before me, but the ratio of sausage, bacon, and cheese is nowhere close to fair.

What is the best way to communicate to her that I would like others in the office to be mindful of vegetarian options for vegetarians? Is that even fair to ask? Easily an exemption would be honored for someone who is vegetarian for religious reasons: ""Office, please leave a vegetarian options for those whose diets do not consume meat."" She said in her email to me ""I do my best. It's time consuming for me to get breakfast."" I want to say something because she even CC'd the owner of the company and the supervisor of my department, so I feel a little bullied by her response.

vegetarian,"Meat cravings after over a decade of vegetarianism I’ve been a strict vegetarian for 13 years. I made the switch in undergrad as a result of a lot of research into climate change and I never looked back. Pretty quickly, meat became repulsive to me, and I started to go in and out of veganism (I can’t quit cheese). But in recent years I’ve found myself absolutely daydreaming about smoked salmon and crispy fried chicken. Just those 2 things. They haunt me! I remember their flavor and texture perfectly. It’s hard to write about now without feeling a powerful craving.

Prior to becoming a vegetarian I focused a lot of my efforts on cutting out highly processed foods from my diet. I am only 3 months into vegetarianism and have found myself very hesitant to try a lot of the ""substitutes"" ie beyond meat, frozen veggie patties, faux chicken, etc. because the processing makes me a little nervous.

Do you ever consider processing when buying food? Are you okay with eating anything as long as it is not meat? How do you see the pros and cons and what is your philosophy on the matter?"

vegetarian,"The reason I became vegetarian, was because of math. It was 3 years ago. I was doing my homework for pre-calculus. I was so frustrated because I couldn't understand a single thing. I'm not quite sure how exactly it happened. I just know that I saw some round circles in my homework, then I related it to my recent weight gain. Then I screamed out ""I'm never eating meat again"". Prior to that, I ate a whole bucket of KFC.

It was honestly pretty hard, starting out. The first 3 months was a total drag. As time went by tho, I started to experiment with my cooking. Making it more interesting with every dish. I saw the variety of flavor that you could enjoy with vegetables and some spices. I saw how creative some chefs are with the food. I'm so glad that there are many recipes out there from India, they make the best vegetable dishes.

I honestly thought that I wouldn't last more than 3 months of being a vegetarian. I realized that after the initial 3 months, I couldn't eat meat. I tried to eat some meat after the 3 months, then it made me vomit. The whole idea of chewing on meat became detestable to me. Now, I'm still enjoying my vegetarian diet all because of my math homework.

It's not overpowering or anything but it definitely has a spice to it.

The problem is that I can't do spicy foods. It's on the low end of spicy but I can't eat a dish with it unless I were to lessen it. I was thinking of something with cream but I honestly don't make soup often, let alone vegetarian soups, so I'm kind of at a complete loss. The only thing I can think of is a potato soup but I have eight cups of broth that I was hoping to use for a few different things... Just not spicy things.

vegetarian,"I finally convinced my carnivore husband he doesn’t need meat. Alas, victory is mine. My husband grew up in FarmVille America and is a huge meat eater. Ribs, chicken, steaks, were typical dinner requests. I occasionally eat meat but it’s not particularly my jam. I had always been privy to cook some for family dinner because it is his preference. However, I’ve been slowly transitioning our family into eating less meat and more veggie based meals to save the planet. (Along with ridding our house of single use plastics ect.) my husband was not enthused. He would never complain openly about it but would give the occasional eye roll. 
Yesterday I was able to claim victory over his bleak outlook. He had a friend over and I served meatless tortilla soup. As I was prepping the food his yeehaw friend said “what meat is in it?” and I replied “none.” His friend was rather taken aback and had a mildly concerned/disgusted look on his face. To which my husband replied “L rarely makes food with meat in it anymore, honestly I haven’t been able to notice and I’ve lost a few pounds.”
YASSS VICTORY IS MINE.

vegetarian,"Thoughts on shellac? I have come across several products that are labeled as vegetarian and contain ""confectioner's glaze"", and am wondering what your opinion on this is.

According to the Vegetarian Society, ""Shellac resin secreted by the female lac bug, sometimes labelled as E904. Used in confectionery products as a glazing agent, and to reduce moisture loss in fruit. Alternatives include plant waxes. The Vegetarian Society considers shellac to be vegetarian, but not vegan.

The female lac insect produces a resin to cocoon the eggs she lays. When the eggs hatch they eat the female (which dies naturally after laying eggs). Once the newly hatched insects leave the cocoon, it is then harvested to produce shellac. The Vegetarian Society Approved team only accredit shellac companies that can demonstrate the quality of their lac beetle husbandry."""

He is supportive(like always&lt;3) but definitly dissapointed. First it was explaining the diffrence between vegan and vegetarian. Then explaining that I will eat it sometimes... but he is still dissapointed that he cant share his love for meat with me. I dont want him to feel that down in the dumps about it. Any advice?
vegetarian,"My husband said he would try to be vegitarian for a month if i would try the all meat carnivore diet for a month. I wish my husband could let go of meat. He says he likes some veggies but those veggies are: potatoes, fried zucchini, cooked tomatos and surprisingly carrots... but only cooked. He wont eat anything unless its been cooked which is the least of problems to be fair.  Anyone got any suggestions? Keep in mind he is a picky eater like a child.



His friend has extolled to him the wonders of the carnivore diet and spouted absolutely ludicrous claims and false information without actually using legitimate data to back these claims. So now i'm in this quandary where my husband will try vegetarian for a month if i try carnivore. 


I am vegetarian for health reasons, i have digestive issues if i eat meat, TMI warning; i get diarrhea, i vomit. I cant sleep well, and just generally feel like a pile of sewage. I switched to mostly plant based with the occasional bit of cheese or egg and immediately felt results. I can have a meal without fearing the results of eating. 



My husband attempted to find research but claimed he couldn't find anything definitive about either😒


Can y'all provide links to any unbiased research and info/proof? I ask this way cause i don't want him to discount it cause ""a vegitarian/vegan wrote this, of course they're gonna say its the better one"""

vegetarian,"Is it worth breaking up with non-vegetarian partner over this? Hi guys ,I have been dating my bf for 2 years now and at the beginning I thought at some point he can be vegetarian (he said it , but didn’t know how serious it was). I always wanted to date vegetarian but when I fell for this guy and saw how supportive he is (he cooks vegetarian for us all the time) I thought it could work. 
I now don’t have a problem with him but I’m kinda very specific about future children and how they should eat. I said that our kids should be vegetarian until they are like 10years old and then decide, even then I won’t feed them meat or cook meat but he can if he wants to. I will make sure that they get the nutrition needed as they grow, but at the age of 10 if they decided to eat meat at family gatherings or with him I’m ok with it.

He said that to him age doesn’t matter , and whatever age they ask for meat he can’t say no just because I want to (which I understand as he’s also their parent)
But this really hurts me, I’m not vegetarian for health reasons or for the environment. I literally see eating animals as a murder and I can’t help it, i believe that I really want to try to teach my kids that animals are worth living as much as us and we shouldn’t kill them for food unless our survival depends on it. And when they are 10 if they have different views on it then okay but until then I want them to have this lifestyle. 
My partner doesn’t seem like his gonna change his mind , and I thought about ending the relationship for this. I love him , we get along but at the same time not sharing the same value on this makes me not see a future I wanted with him.

My friends are not vegetarian and think I’m at fault, I get the whole don’t force your kids thing. But if you believed something was as big as a murder would u still say let your kids choose?

I'm a 20 year male who's father eats meat every day of his life, and who would throw a fit if I were to tell him that I wanted to stop. My dad is a great guy, but has very strict and particular views. He believes that because I am a ""growing boy"", meat is essential and required. There are a variety of reasons for which I've made this decision, most of which are probably shared among the vast majority of you - though the main one consists of simply not wanting to eat those poor animals...

It doesn't help that he and my mother cook meat 4 or 5 times per week for dinner alone. My mom, luckily, supports my decision, though, which is good. I've mad a variety of lifestyle changes over the past year (all for the better!) and know that he would go on a rant about wanting to change my identity and beliefs and such. The truth is that I've been considering this for a very long time, and have decided that it is enough. I just don't want to him to be pissed at me for a long time. He hold grudges. 

Have any of  gone through this? If so, what arguments have you brought up? Yes, I will tell him that its mainly for the morality behind it, but he will most likely see that as ""weak"" and ""not manly."" Regardless, though, this is something I want to do. I don't mind preparing my own dinners at all. It'll be a fun process to learn how to cook at the same time.

I handle most of the cooking, and it's been going very well so far. I've learned a lot of new recipes, and managed to convince my partner that mushrooms and spinach are not the devil.

I've had a bit of an issue this past week though. My partners favourite dinner is lasagne. I tried cooking one following my usual recipe, but using quorn mince instead of regular mince the other night, and it did not work. At all. The mince had the consistency of badly mashed potato, and the whole thing was like trying to eat a soggy sponge. So far as I could tell, the mince just retained far too much moisture in comparison to how typical beef mince would behave.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I could cook this to make it more like a typical meat-based lasagne? My flatmate suggested that quorn mince has a reputation for being rubbish in general, so I'll try again using a different product, at least."

Another year to get into remission. During that time, I couldn't eat any fiber at all without being violently ill. I tried my best to eat the mushiest, least fibrous fruits and veggies around but felt my best basically just eating chicken, eggs, and cheese. I have been in clinical remission for a year, but am having trouble eating plant based again. Many of the most tasty and protein filled veggies give me incredible bloating and pain. I'm not sure if my gut microbiome is wack, or if I just can't digest things the way I used to, but it's discouraging. Eating low fodmap helps me a lot but it's just so restrictive to be on long term.

I'm reasonably healthy and try to stay so, but I honestly find it very hard to maintain a healthy vegetarian diet. Sometimes on this sub I see people claiming that they're vegetarian for health reasons: why, and what do you eat?

What is it about a vegetarian diet that is more healthy? To me, a clear example of a healthy meal is a lean cut of chicken with a salad on the side, while a clear example of an unhealthy meal is pizza and french fries.




Since transitioning to a more vegetarian diet I have been eating *a lot* more carbohydrates, because vegetables alone just don't fill me, no matter how much I eat: I'll be full initially, but hungry again shortly after. A diet of pasta, bread, potatoes and rice is not healthy. The other night I made grilled portobello mushrooms and asparagus, which was delicious, but I ate a ton of bread an hour later.

 I usually eat a lot of vegetables, they are one of the main ingredients in virtually all of my meal, but to be full I have to pair them with carbs. To eat something different, I have to resort to vegan substitutes of meat, which are surprisingly good but in the end highly processed food in a plastic container, which I would like to avoid as much as possible.

Unfortunately, due to the stereotypes like ""vegetarians can only eat raw carrots"", it seems this sub mainly focuses on what unhealthy vegetarian comfort food can you eat, which is awesome, but it leaves me wondering what the healthy options are."

vegetarian,"Lacking flavor in veggie dishes Hey r/vegetarian,

since I moved in with my girlfriend, I've been trying to cook different dishes, since she is not a fan of eating pasta five times per week. In the last two weeks I tried three new recipes:

1. A freestyled Asian dish, with a base of coconut milk and left other veggies
2. A non-vegetarian pea soup, where I left the meat parts Out
3. A vegan goulash with marinated soy chunks

All of these tasted alright, but overall were lacking in the flavor department. I can get behind this for the pea soup because I just canceled the strong umami flavors and did not replace it with anything. But I was disappointed by the flavors of the goulash because the marinade was based on soy sauce, balsamico, tomato purree, combined with onions and red wine. 

I am therefore looking for a way to improve my flavors in cooking. How can I replace meat (umami-wise)? How to I develop stronger flavors in stews and such? Should I Invest more time in the cooking process overall?

Lately I have been trying to reduce the amount of meat I eat and starting to have more full vegetarian meals (especially on weekdays. I still eat some meat on weekends). 

I have several vegetarian recipes I've collected and make pretty regularly but nearly all of them are of the soup/stew/other type of meal that's very homogeneous (Some of the meals I make are Ratatouille, mushroom bourguignon, bean stew, that type of thing) They are delicious but all of them boil down to having a bowl of food that's \*mostly\* the same taste and texture.

I am missing the feeling of something like chicken breast and some rice where you have 2 distinct parts to the meal. I don't want to rely on ""meat substitutes"" like tofu or seitan because they tend to be a little expensive where I live and I get bored of them pretty quickly. The only type of meal I found to fill this hole so far are vegetarian burgers (black bean, mushroom and so on). I was wondering if anyone can recommend something similar."

vegetarian,"Relationship with a Meat Eater Hi everyone. I need help. My bf and I have been together for 13 years. We both started being vegetarians in 2017 when we had to put our cat down. Last year he started to eat meat again. I didn’t want to be “that vegetarian “ and force my values on him but it has been a sore spot in our relationship. 

Today, he gets invited by his uncle to butcher a deer with him next week or so and he said yes. When he told me this, I freaked out and broke up with him. I understand the intellectual interest in learning how to but it’s just so against my core values that I broke up with him. Idk if that was the right thing to do. I love him. We’ve been together for a long time. But the idea of him helping mutilate a dead carcass disgusted me so much that I became instantly angry and when he refused to decline the butchering lesson, I told him I couldn’t be with him. 

It’s also upsetting that he knew this action would upset me/goes against my entire belief system, and he said yes without even discussing it with me. I feel completely betrayed and disrespected. He said he wants to learn, is interested in anatomy, interested in survivalists, and the opportunity presented itself. It makes me feel like he could do other things that he knows would upset me/go against who I am and still do it just because the opportunity presented itself. 

I have no vegetarian friends.

Have any of you dated a meat eater? 

What’s even worse is that we moved from ca to md five days ago and I’m all alone here with no friends or family. The moving pod hasn’t even arrived yet. I feel trapped, angry, afraid, sad, and betrayed."

vegetarian,"When you make chickpeas in an instant pot, how are you supposed to do that thing where you toss the soaking water that can make you gassy? I've heard that when you do the traditional method of making chickpeas (soaking overnight, then cooking on the stovetop), you're supposed to toss the soaking water bc it has compounds that can make you gassy. I've not personally made chickpeas bc I've always been content to use Goya. 

But I've recently gone vegetarian, and am considering getting an Instant Pot in part due to the ability to fast-cook legumes, and am just wondering how you are supposed to handle chickpeas if there is no pre-soaking component."
vegetarian,"Curating vegetarian recipes for others? Hi fellow vegetarians,

I was curious if any of you would like to or already curate existing vegetarian recipes (published by others across the web)? While there are many recipe websites, I have been wondering if vegetarian enthusiasts can start curating the best recipes from different sources into one place. For example, someone into vegetarian Indian cooking can curate the best traditional Indian vegetarian recipes from different websites and sources on an ongoing basis? That way people can follow food curators vs. having to go through multiple websites to figure out the best recipe for anything. What do you think?"

On the other side, I read that the estrogen present in legumes is different and doesn't cause hormonal imbalances. 

The biggest thing for me was the high dosage. I eat around 500g of boiled chickpeas everyday and another 300-500g of other legumes i.e. Kidney beans, Mung beans, Soy beans etc. So, even if estrogen was present in small amounts, wouldn't it add up? What's considered a safe dosage and what's too much? It'd be fantastic if someone could help me out with this."

My husband's grandma has recently been diagnosed with mouth/throat cancer. She is a loooong time vegetarian (pretty sure it's 50+ years!). She's having a really hard time keeping her weight up due to not being able to eat hard/scratchy foods. They cause her throat pain. She was already a thin woman so this is not good.

My husband and I live two houses down and have been doing some shopping/cooking for her. I'm vegetarian myself (but much more recently) so I have a few ideas of things to meal prep her but would appreciate any ideas you guys have. She does eat dairy and eggs which makes things easier.

We have access to Wal-Mart (preferred), Costco, and a few smaller local grocery stores. Meat replacement/frozen foods are fine but obviously healthy foods are a plus right now. She really likes Morning Star breakfast sandwiches but they cause too much pain.

Thanks ahead of time guys.

vegetarian,"If you were gifted or accidentally given meat, would you eat it? The title basically says it all, but allow me to further explain:


I've been vegetarian for 90 days, and this is a question that's been weighing on me, so I figured I'd just get some opinions from other Veggies before coming to any conclusions. 


A few days ago, my boyfriend and I went through the Burger King drive thru for some Impossible Whoppers. After ordering, it took almost 15 minutes to get our food, and once we finally got it, we realized that they ""gifted"" us with 20 complementary chicken nuggets. This was great for my boyfriend, as he's omnivorous (he ordered a chicken sandwich with his meal, so maybe they thought we were both omni?), but obviously it didn't benefit me in any way. He ate the nuggets happily, and I just took some of his fries as compensation.


Today, I went to Taco Bell and asked for a side of beans and rice. The person misheard me, and gave me a side of beef in addition to my beans and rice. My boyfriend is not with me, so he can't eat the beef. This leads me to my question. 


What would you do in these situations? Pretend you don't have a partner and are ""gifted"" 20 chicken nuggets, or you accidentally are given a side of beef in the drive thru. Do you eat the meat so that it doesn't go to waste, or do you throw it away? What do you do with it? I feel like this is something that could happen again to me in the future (and I'm sure has/will happen to others too), and I just wanted to see what everyone's thoughts were. Thank you!!"

vegetarian,"My younger cousin (12M) turned vegetarian a year ago. His parents lie to him about his ""vegetarian"" meals. Hi r/vegetarian! I was trying to get my christmas shopping out of the way and had no idea what to get for my younger cousin, who I'm not very close to (both relationship- and distance-wise). I thought that maybe I could gift him something helpful, but after thinking about the situation I just  felt overall uncomfortable. It's always been a source of uneasiness for me that I've pushed to the side, but I would appreciate hearing what you guys think.

He went vegetarian after watching a documentary and it's a pretty messy situation. He has a strong moral code and is a lil bit of a stubborn brat. His parents are not equipped or prepared to meet his needs. I've seen his parents just give him rice - which is definitely not enough for a growing boy - or give him food and lie to him that it's vegetarian so he'll eat it. (Pho - which is a bone marrow stew made from cow or chicken bones.)

I feel conflicted about the situation — I admire his determination and sense of right and wrong, especially as he's so young, and I think good parents would support his decision and learn how to provide for him. However, I do understand that they're busy and it's a big committment to learn how to cook.

Ideally, they would just do their research and learn how to cook vegetarian, but they're kind of meh people and constantly exasperated with their kid. I'm sure his mom is trying, but she tends to just give him what he wants/placate him instead of being real with him. He's a lil spoiled and threw tantrums a lot as a kid.

Another option would be to tell him that if he wants to be vegetarian, he has to put in the work, but he's also 12. He hasn't really done his own research other than meat = bad, and he doesn't cook. He IS very determined though, but I think that would just result in him not eating/being malnourished instead of learning how to eat by himself, which is obviously not good.

Honestly, I feel like it's a respectable choice but he's too young to make the decision, especially since his parents aren't prepared to support him. Note that I've only observed the situation from the outside and I don't have all the facts — and it's been awhile. I was just there for the few family gatherings where they fed him pho. I tried to say something to him at the time and they shushed me. I kept my mouth shut because I figured it wasn't any of my business and there wasn't any other food for him, but I still feel uneasy about to this day.

Anyway, I just want to know what you guys think about it and what you would do in my place! This was originally going to be a post asking about what christmas gift would be suitable for him*, but now it's just me grappling with a moral dilemma. Please lend me your insight!

TL;DR: Young cousin wants to be vegetarian but understandably isn't prepared to provide for himself. Parents occasionallg placate him by giving him food that's not actually vegetarian and lying about it or undernourishing him. What can be done for this situation?

*But if you guys have any gift ideas, that would still be appreciated lmao. I was thinking a vegetarian cookbook, but he doesn't like cooking and he isn't interested in it. That would probably be a better gift for the parents, except... I don't give them christmas gifts lmao."

I'm talking about the intermediate stage of coconut ripeness, between young (drinking) coconut and brown mature coconut. It has a flaky, hairy white shell on the outside and does not come shrink wrapped. You crack it in half like a mature coconut, you don't shave a hole in the top like a young coconut. 

They're the best for eating raw, IMO. The meat is sweet, easy to chew, and easier to extract from the shell. There is nearly as much sweet coconut water as those young coconuts with jellylike meat, and the water is more pleasant than mature coconuts. There is about as much coconut fragrance as a mature coconut but it's easier to work with. It's the true best of both worlds. 

But I want to cook with at least one of the two I have left. I could puree it or grate it and use it like coconut cream or milk, but I'm wondering if there are any recipes that use the unique chewy texture of this fruit to its full advantage without pulverizing it beyond recognition. Like, can I marinate it? Desserts that showcase the texture? What are they usually used for besides eating raw? 

The information is just so hard to find in English because ""immature coconut"" just brings up drinking coconuts and ""white coconut"" just gives you pictures of the mature meat so I'm very curious what is done with them."

vegetarian,"Switching to a Vegetarian Diet So I am in my 30s and could say 99.9% of the meals I've had were non vegetarian. Over the past few years I've felt worse about eating meat and would like to switch to a Vegetarian Diet.

One thing that holds me back is figuring out what to eat. Whenever I try to look up things to eat, all I see are what looks to be meals aimed at a 19 year old girls instagram. Throwing some granola over lettuce and a tomato is not gonna cut it for a guy who eats a ribeye for lunch. 

Im trying to eat healthier as well, but I also don't want to feel hungry all day long. Guys or anyone with big appetites, what kind of things do you do to eat vegetarian consistently? I'd really like some tips, if you have any good links I'd appreciate that as well. I am familiar with indian food, so any other suggestions besides that would be helpful"

* Low sodium. Shooting for 1,000mg a day from the diet; I'll get another 500mg from snacks that I have determined I don't want to give up
* High protein. We're shooting for 160g a day, minimum 80g. 
* No broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, onion, or garlic. (cries with garlic scented breath)
* Somewhat plant based, but vegan is not necessary
   * Skim milk is allowed only in recipes.

zerocarb,"READ THIS BEFORE POSTING AND CARNI-CURIOUS [UPDATED October 26, 2020] Welcome to [r/zerocarb](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb).

Our  definition of zerocarb is a carnivorous diet.  We only eat meat and  animal products.  We do not consume plants for nutrients or calories.    Some animal products contain carbs (e.g. dairy), most of those are  acceptable.  Some plant products contain no carbs (e.g. plant oils), and  those are generally not acceptable.

Are you interested in trying a carnivore/zerocarb way of eating?  Do you have simple questions about it? You can ask here. Vegetarians and vegans can post in this thread without an automatic ban, so long  as  they are asking honest questions and not trying to promote  plant-based  diets or spread misinformation about the dangers of meat.

The  term 'zerocarb' is historical and dates back to Owsley ""The Bear""  Stanley.  While many members choose to also use other terms, like  carnivore, we will always consider ourselves zerocarb.

If  you are really interested in eating this way, you should read ""The Fat  of the Land"" and ""Bear's Words of Wisdom.""  They are both pinned to the  top of the subreddit in the Free PDFs dropdown.  These are considered  required reading.  If you find some person or website promoting advice contrary to the information in those documents (e.g. Saladino), do not be surprised when we delete it.

We do not have a reddit chat, but there is a place if you want a live chat: [u/LogicalLynx](https://www.reddit.com/user/LogicalLynx) runs it on discord: [https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp](https://discord.gg/CR9gPvp)

# Check the [Let's Get Started: Beginner Questions and Answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/dc2lgh/lets_get_started_beginner_questions_and_answers/) FAQ Thread for how to get started.

# Purpose

This subreddit exists to:

* provide information about the zerocarb way of eating
* provide support for those eating zerocarb and those who want to try or are trying, to eat zerocarb
* provide a community for zerocarbers to interact and share experiences

We are **not**  a debate subreddit.  There are plenty of places for you to discuss the  health benefits of consuming plants.  This is not the place.  We have  heard it all before.  If you are not on a zerocarb diet or transitioning  to one, you are not guaranteed a right to participate here.  Yes, that  means we reserve the right to ban people just for being vegans,  vegetarians, or bots (which don't eat and thus aren't zerocarb). If you  are veg\*n, you may only post in threads tagged ""VEG\*NS ALLOWED.""  If you  post elsewhere, you can be banned. 

The  focus of this subreddit is on eating an all-animal-products diet.  Conversations about unrelated topics may be deleted as they are not  appropriate here.  Conversations about other ways of eating, even  conversations about how those ways of eating are misguided, are not  appropriate here.  It is not the purpose of this subreddit to attack or  mock other ways of eating.

This subreddit makes the assumption that you are an intelligent adult and capable of making your own health choices.  We are wary of making recommendations towards children and teens.  If you are interested in an all-meat diet for your child or you are a teen who is interested, we encourage you to work directly with a medical professional.

If you are interested in a meat-heavy diet, one which is almost carnivore but includes some plant foods, which don't cause you issues, this is not the appropriate place to have those conversations.  If this describes you, you may have your right to post removed.  There are two potential subreddits that were created to host those discussions.  We have r/carnivorish and r/dirtycarnivores.  Those subreddits are currently small, but you can help them grow.  A responsible person who helps those subreddits become thriving communities will be considered for a moderator position there.

There are  lifestyle choices that you may believe are related to eating this way,  but there is nothing universal here except the avoidance of plant foods.   Those discussions are best when held in subreddits that are  appropriate for them.

# We are not an extreme weight loss subreddit

Weight  normalization will happen with zerocarb.  If you are overweight, you  will reach a healthy weight.  If you are underweight, you will also  reach a healthy weight.   Weight normalization is just a symptom of the  primary goal.  We are about long-term health and wellness.  This isn't  ""extreme keto"" where you get double your weight loss for extreme carb  denial.

We discourage messages  advocating or encouraging food and calorie restriction, even subtle  messages of this manner.  Do not tell people they need to eat less.  Do  not tell people they are eating too much.  Don't tell people they gained  weight because they ate too much or lost weight because they were  eating less.  Don't tell people to eat leaner meat or try fasting.  This is not a debatable subject.  We don't host CICO  discussions here.

From the Bear's Thread:

&gt;I do advise however, that fasting and severely low caloric intake is NOT a very good idea for your health.\[. . .\]The  meat regime does not require fasting, which is what 1100 cal/day is.  You can eat 5000 cal/day and lose bodyfat. You are eating far too  little. Eat 80% (cal) in fat, 20% (cal) in lean. This is instinctive.  Don’t measure. Choose a nice fatty cut of meat, cook very little (blood  rare or bleu), eat mostly of the fat at first, until you don’t feel like  any more fat (built-in response), then eat the lean until satiated.  Save any left-overs in the fridge for later.‘Dieting’ by measuring fat and lean, and restricting caloric intake DOES NOT WORK as a way to acquire and keep a normal body.\[ . . .\]Calorie restriction and/or ‘partial fasting’ are neither necessary nor desirable.

# We are our own Zerocarb Group

We are a cousin to the Facebook groups: [Zeroing In On Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/zioh2/), [Zero Carb Health](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ZeroCarbHealth/), [Principia Carnivora](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PrincipiaCarnivora/), and [World Carnivore Tribe](https://www.facebook.com/groups/163527891074530/).    But, we are not a direct offshoot of these and exist in our own  right. Many of us are members of one or more of the facebook groups or  other zerocarb groups.  You are encouraged to join other groups that  interest you.  Do not try and argue that we should run our subreddit  differently because these groups may run themselves differently.  We  know that some groups permit discussions that we don't allow here.   Other reddit groups that are distinct but related to ours include r/CarnivoreForum,  [r/carnivore](https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivore/), and [r/rawzerocarb](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawzerocarb/).

# Rules and Behavior

1. **No Unrepentant Vegans / Vegetarians**:  Plant-eaters who are looking to improve themselves and heal are  welcome. If you come here trying to promote a non-meat diet, you're  violating this rule.  If you have honest questions, you can post them   inside threads tagged ""VEG\*NS ALLOWED.""  Attempting to post outside  those threads can cause you to be banned.
2. **No Dangerous Diet Practices:**    Don't tell people to not drink water, don't tell people to avoid  vaccinations, don't tell people to not eat for days on end, don't tell  people to eat raw foods. People trying to discuss raw will get an  automated message referring them to [r/rawzerocarb](https://www.reddit.com/r/rawzerocarb/), as we don't have the moderating resources to correct misinformation here.
3. **No Abuse To Others:**   Be nice even to people who aren't zerocarb.  You can disagree.   You  can argue.  You can't insult, demean, or belittle.  Threats,  insults,  and profanity directed towards people or groups are not part of the  community.  People who argue for argument's sake may be banned.
4. **No Non-Zerocarb Advice, Recommendations, or Discussions:**   Do not recommend plants foods, supplements, fiber, or anything else  along those lines.  Don't give advice that includes personal experience  that isn't zerocarb. This includes posts about eating plant foods, honey, and/or  cheats. It also includes advice about unrelated lifestyle choices.  We  are here to discuss eating this way.  There are other subreddits more  appropriate for other topics.  This includes CICO-based advice, discussions, or ideas.
5. **No Self-Promotion or Low Effort Posts:**  No self-promotion, (i.e. come look at my youtube channel), personal  blogs/vlogs, affiliate links, product links, promotion of outside  groups, surveys/market research posts. If you want to advertise, buy  some Reddit ads. Low-effort posts will likely be removed ... if the only  thing in a post is the title and/or a link, it will be removed as  low-effort. When starting a post or linking to a study/article etc.  please include a tl;dr or your own thoughts/reactions to get the  conversation started.  Posts which include referral links (usually amazon) will be deleted without comment.
6. **Other**: No brigading, no complaining about other subreddits or moderators, behave like an adult, and other miscellaneous stuff that should be common sense.

We are pro-health.  That includes sexual health.  Posts which discourage healthy activities, including healthy sexual activities, are not appropriate here.

We usually hand approve all video posts, watching them first.  A video that includes advice or content that is not allowed here will not be approved.  If a video is long, it can take a much longer time to get reviewed.  At times, with heavy moderation loads, we can remove videos without reviewing them first.  Our default reaction is to remove a video, not approve one.

Breaking  any of the above could result in getting your post deleted, future  posts being manually reviewed, and/or being banned from the subreddit.   Using **bold** in your posts is  disallowed by a historical rule.  Breaking this rule usually only  results in our asking you to edit it and remove the bold.   Your posts  can also be removed if they make it obvious that you didn't read this  post first.  ***Please  report posts that you think might violate rules.  The mods don't always  see everything, and we rely on you to alert us to things that we miss.***

# Debatable Subjects

There are some discussion topics where we hold varied opinions.  These include, but are not limited to:

* coffee, tea, and other beverages *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* artificial sweeteners *\[generally not permitted\]*
* salt, spices, and seasonings *\[generally permitted by most\]*
* intermittent fasting and meal timing *\[accepted when it is natural, discouraged when it is artificial and forced\]*
* occasional use of plant oils (like in a mayonnaise) *\[bad stuff, and the least possible amount is the best\]*
* eggs and dairy *\[most people tolerate these well, but they are the first things we think of when people have problems\]*
* organ meats and liver *\[some swear by them, but many people never eat them and are healthy\]*
* grass fed meat or grain finished meat *\[the biggest issue here should be about animal treatment, as the nutritional value of the two categories is insignificant with the amounts we eat\]*

You  will find that many people end up on different sides of the argument  about these.  The *\[text\]* describes the default position of most people.  But, almost all of us would agree that this is arguing  about the last couple percentage points of perfection.  Eating meat (avoiding plant foods) and drinking water gets a person 98% of the way  there.  If spices and cheese help you stick to just eating meat, you're  better off having them than giving up entirely.  In general, we ask that you refrain from suggesting that something from this list is necessary for success.  And, we certainly don't want you telling people to engage in those things were are generally discouraged.

It should be noted that honey is not an animal food.  It is absolutely not tolerated here.  Recommending honey, in any amounts, or trying to argue that it should be permitted will cause the posts to be removed and even first infractions can result in loss of posting privileges.

We  welcome experience reports, even if you struggled or failed.  We  encourage people to try this out and give it a shot.  But, there is a difference between talking about how you're going to try it and asking us how to incorporate plants back into your diet after that trial up.  Trying it and then evaluating is one  thing.   We aren't going to help you plan plant consumption.  Participate here, while you try it.  If your first post is to tell use that you have done it for six months and your left foot exploded and leaked butter all over your couch, you will find us a bit skeptical as to the veracity of your tale.  We don't need you posting ""Goodbye"" posts.

# My post was deleted or doesn't show up

We  get a lot of hate and a bunch of spam here.  If your post doesn't show  up or gets caught in a filter, and you believe this is in error,  feel  free to message the moderators.  If you spot abusive or off-topic posts,  please report them and we will get on top of them as soon as possible.

There is a certain account age and karma, below which your posts will automatically be removed.  We don't post specific numbers, to discourage people from attempting to find ways around them.  Attempting to get around these limitations can result in your account permanently being filtered.

If  you disagree with a post being deleted, you can message the mods and  try and have a reasonable conversation with us.  We allow some moderator  discretion when it comes to approving and deleting posts.  Having an attitude or attacking the moderators will not help you.  It is likely to make us decide against you, and might result in loss of posting privileges here.  Please note the right for moderators to use discretion.  If we do not allow your post, but we did allow a similar post, that does not mean we have an obligation to approve your post. We make no apologies for heavy-handed moderation.  This is a very specific way of eating.  When people try and dilute or change the way we do things, we are not obligated to provide them an area on this subreddit to promote their variations."

zerocarb,"Orthostatic Hypotension Hello everyone, looking for a little insight here.

Since I was a teen Ive had issues with getting up too fast and getting dizzy. In the beginning I had quire a few episodes of actually passing out. Got checked and was told I had low blood pressure and to consume more salt, which seems to help. I eat more salt nowadays (at least way more than when I had the passing out episodes), and I no longer pass out. Still occasional dizziness.

So, does anyone here who has been on zerocarb have experience with orthostatic hypotension? Did you have to eat a boatload of salt in the beginning stages not only for diet transition but to aid your dizzy spells? Im trying to figure out how to approach this or just any insight from some zerocarbers with this condition. I feel like this condition may make my transition more complicated.

zerocarb,"Rock Climbing ""guru"" Dave Mcloud goes Carnivore (improved strenght and eczema resolved) https://www.instagram.com/p/CHzkX-ODwrI/?igshid=1949r0q3alxmz

&gt;I’m exactly four weeks into another diet experiment, this time my second round of carnivore diet (my first was in 2018). I’m doing it to test a very specific outcome. I’ve had severe eczema all my life which affects my feet. I was hospitalised as a kid for it and spent a bit of time unable to walk at times. Pain, itch, broken, bleeding skin and resulting infection and topical steroid medication has been a constant part of my life since then. I basically cringed every single time I put on or took of rock shoes, with pain.

&gt; However, in that first carnivore experiment, my eczema unexpectedly disappeared completely, for the duration of the diet. It also disappeared completely during the prolonged fasts I’ve done (but obviously they are necessarily temporary). So I obviously had to repeat the carnivore experiment.
&gt; 
&gt; This time around, the same thing has happened, the eczema just stopped by the second day and is 100% gone. In due course I’ll need to reintroduce some favoured plant foods one at a time to monitor for specific foods or ingredients that provoke symptoms. I’ve done baseline bloods and will have another round of bloods after another month or two. More on that in a video soon. But a nice additional side effect has been that I feel really strong. I’ve just been trad climbing and with only 6 or 7 fingerboard/board sessions since June. I should be really weak. But I could just step straight on the fingerboard and break my PBs on all grip types, first try. Excellent!

But I’m not going another fucking day feeling like garbage because I’ve strayed from the diet I know will help my plethora of autoimmune symptoms. This is DAY ONE.

zerocarb,"8 months, 29F, still no weight loss I am 8 months carnivore and still have not experienced any weight loss or significant body change. I’m just wondering if others can share their experiences of reaching weight loss later in their journey. I am just trying to keep hope that this will happen for me at some point. I eat mostly ground beef and ribeyes, eggs, butter, salmon. Dairy sometimes. I eat till hunger usually twice sometimes 3x per day. I’ve found that increasing fat significantly now causes me diarrhea, so I am listening to my body and don’t overload the fat.

For context, I come from a background of almost 10 years of dieting with periods of restriction and obsessive macro counting. I imagine this has messed up my hormones and metabolism to an extent, but I didn’t think it would take this long to correct. Otherwise I have no significant health issues (at least observably). 

I have experienced many NSV on this WOE:
Digestion perfect.
Acne is gone.
Anxiety greatly reduced.
Nagging hamstring injury healed.
No more dry skin on face.
No more gas/bloating.
Have not had a single cold sore outbreak.
Sleep is way better.

zerocarb,"Why is it so hard for me to eat liver (raw or not)? Thing is, I've done my research and I know that liver is the most nutritious organ you could eat. The issue is that every time I eat it, I can't really eat more than a bite size because of the taste (don't feel like texture is an issue).

zerocarb,"Coping with temptations over the holidays. I was wondering how the rest of you guys cope over the holidays with all the tempting foods? I’ve been zerocarb for 2 years now this Christmas. I’m so thankful I found out about this way of eating because it has changed my life and my health for the better and that is something I’m extremely grateful for.

However, I do eat this way because I have to, not because I want to. And I mean I have to because if I stray from this way if eating even a little bit I’ll pay for it for days, possibly weeks. I have always been more of a meat eater so it makes it easy for me to eat this way, but I also enjoy eating non meat things as well. 

I find this time of year makes it especially tough with all the delicious holiday foods in the grocery stores. People cooking and sharing their favorite holiday dishes, Christmas chocolates, cookies, etc. These are traditions that we grew up with and it’s really hard not to share and enjoy them with the people we love. It makes it hard too that people don’t really understand. Food is a way of connecting and sharing with people and I really miss that sometimes, especially this time of year. But like I said, for me it’s not worth it to even attempt these foods because I will suffer, so I know I’m making the right decision. 

I’m just wondering how the rest of you cope with these temptations during the holidays. Thanks for any tips."
zerocarb,"Steak flavors I wasn't sure about flare... Anyhow, steaks have been roughly 50% of my diet over the last year. I still haven't figured out what's the reason for variance I'm taste between otherwise same cuts/type. For i while I thought it has something to do with myoglobin and color but that's not the case. Then I thought it's how cows/bulls are fed (grasfinished vs corn) but that's not the case either.

This is quite frustrating because taste is quite important to me. Some steaks are so delicious I could eat a ton, some have too strong and strange (to me) flavor and I can barely eat them especially while still warm (taste of such steaks becomes slightly better when cold)..

If anyone has any idea about possible reasons I would appreciate any tip/suggestions."

Is it feasible to be eating fish all day? The fish alone will cost $20 a day, but it is wild caught. I will eat the lamb whenever I can get as it is grass fed. 

With those 4 foods I’ll be getting all my micronutrients plus sufficient fat and protein. My concern is will I develop heavy metal poisoning if I stick to trout and salmon?

zerocarb,"Morning routine in the absence of coffee TL;DR - After quitting coffee, what do you do instead every morming to keep a morning routine? 



Hey guys. My fiance and I have been mostly carnivore for almost a year now and both have seen great changes in our health and energy levels. 

Before carnivore we were both big time coffee addicts and still drink way too much, so we're looking to start cutting back, and then cut it out completely. We want to do this to see what our energy and digestion are like without all the caffeine, as well as cutting down on our liquid dairy consumption, which we both now know makes our seasonal allergy congestion worse.

For anybody who used to drink coffee every morning who now doesn't, did you replace the routine with anything? Or did you just get rid of it totally? If you did replace it with something, what do you do/drink now instead of making coffee? 

I really like the consistancy of waking up to do the same thing every morning and am worried that I'll miss it, or that my whole morning or day will be off because of it."

Maybe I just haven't noticed it before or maybe its because I eat pork fairly infrequently but last week I ate slow cooked pork and the next two days I had a stomach ache. Now, to be fair I did also eat some sugar alcohol in my coffee which does kill my gut. So, I chalked it up to the sugar replacement. However it did pique my curiosity because this type of thing has happened before.

Chicken and beef does wonders for me especially beef although I do need to watch the fat content per a meal. Now, yesterday I ate a pound of pork. I fried these little steaklets in butter and that evening I felt awful at the gym. This incessant feeling in my gut. Strange! The only thing that was different from my diet was the pork. I ate the other meals as chicken and beef. 

I don't know for certain if its the pork. I believe the culprits are pork or coffee, but it definitely seems, based on some anecdotes on Reddit, that the pork is the main culprit. To add to the story I am someone who has gone the all meat route for GI issues and better athletic performance. I can attest to the fact that 99% of the time I feel great but I have these periodic hiccups. This being the latest and it always seems to last 2-3days.

* Are there any vitamins or supplements that you recommend taking while maintaining this diet?
* If I bring this diet up to a primary care physician, are they willing to work with this diet? Perhaps blood tests can show how things are going? 
*  Are fish and poultry easier on the body than beef or pork? Or is this just subjective on a case-by-case basis?

Went home, glanced at the bottles on the fridge, cooked up some burgers, drank a bunch of pellegrino and watched some tv. Now here i am and I’m wondering if this is a health indicator? Inevitable side effect? It’s weird but i like it.

Otherwise I’m doing well, my energy level is better than pre zero carb, but i believe maybe i need some organ meat.

I liked the results, but it is a fairly long and tedious process, and I don't have any extra rendered fat available right now.  I am considering how to handle the remaining skin I have frozen.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a simpler process to cook the pork skin that can yield good results?  It doesn't have to be a puffed pork rind, mind you.  I should add that I did try cooking some of the skin just in the oven alone, and it was a major failure, being both hard (which would be fine if not for this second part) and chewy.

I started by zerocarb journey by eating 3+ pounds of ribeye/strip steak per day (approximately 250+ g protein with a relatively lower amount of fat). Digestion was never quite right - always a little bloated, achy stomach. However, my energy levels were very good. 

The last week or so, I’ve switched to eating roughly 1 kg/2.2 lb of 80/20 ground meat per day. Bloating and stomach pain is gone and I feel generally lighter. Unfortunately, my energy levels are a lot lower. 

I’m considering tinkering with my ratios/quantities a bit to help improve my energy. I’m debating whether to add more pure fat directly (tallow, butter, etc), or just increase the amount of 80/20 ground meat by adding another 500 g or so. I’m wary of overeating protein, as I fear it will just slow down my digestion and leave me back at square one.

I have to eat lamb because I'm sensitive to beef, and oh boy did that lamb taste (and the amount of separated fat) get to me after a while. I developed this meatloaf recipe to solve that problem. One loaf sustains me for an entire day and I'm always disappointed when I get full because I want to eat more!

* Loaf pan and mixing bowl
* 1 lb 80/20 ground lamb (or whatever)
* 6 eggs
* 5 oz or thereabouts soft goat cheese (other soft cheeses may work but I haven't tried -- have tried a gouda (semi-hard) but the meatloaf lost a lot of flavor compared to the soft goat cheese)
* 1 tsp salt

Preheat your oven to 375.

Get out the ground meat and cheese and let them sit out so they can lose their chill (makes them easier to mix and may help the meatloaf cook more evenly).

Boil 5 of the 6 eggs (mine are perfect 8-9 minutes after they begin to boil), peel them, and chop them up as small as you can reasonably get them (no need to be neat, just cut them each in half, dice the halves and then chop randomly with your knife all over them until you have small bits). These eggs, along with the cheese, will prevent the meatloaf from becoming a dense meat brick.

Put your loaf pan next to the mixing bowl.

Plop the 1 lb ground meat, the 6th (raw) egg, the 5 oz cheese, the chopped up boiled eggs, and 1 tsp salt into the mixing bowl and mix it all up with your hands. I like to break up the cheese a bit first before I start mixing everything together, because the cheese likes to stay as big gloppy blobs unless you specifically chase down those blobs. Kneading or squishing the meat like it's playdough may make your meatloaf more dense, so when possible, mix gently, allowing the meat to separate and break up as it sifts through your fingers.

When your meatloaf mixture seems evenly mixed, lift that sucker out of the mixing bowl and plop it into the loaf pan. Give it a loving pat or two to settle it in the pan, and ensure that it fills all four corners of the pan. Wash the clingy meat off your hands and pop your meatloaf in the oven for 50-60 minutes.

When 50-60 minutes have passed, pull your meatloaf out and let it rest for 10-15 minutes at least. This will allow it to firm up for better slicing, and will allow it to reabsorb much of the bubbling bath of fat it's probably sitting in.

After it's rested, dig in! It's best eaten fresh of course, but I can only finish half of one before I'm full. It's still tasty at room temperature 6 hours later, and reheating it in the oven isn't too hard.

Those of you who use spices should be able to make this recipe taste even better. I haven't tried any sort of topping or condiment on it yet -- it's tasty enough plain that I haven't felt the need.

EDIT: Tried with 90/10 bison today -- was still good, but turned out less moist and crumblier (the slices kept breaking in half) than the 80/20 lamb I've been using, so I'll be sticking with the lamb (which IMO has a slightly better flavor than the bison).

EDIT 2: Didn't have any soft goat cheese today, so I tried gouda instead -- the loaf remained the proper density, but the cheese didn't seem to impart its flavor to the meat as easily, leaving the meatloaf tasting kinda plain. I recommend a soft cheese for this recipe if it's available to you."
zerocarb,"Back pain gone after temporarily eating zero carb? Hello,

So first and foremost, I only went on zero carbs temporarily so I could deplete my body's glycogen for reasons that don't really matter for the topic at hand.

What I find interesting, is that my upper back pain that I've been dealing with for 2 years seemingly vanished. I'm trying to get wrap my head around this, and the only thing that changed for the past 2 days is my diet.

Is it possible my pain is gone from the diet change or just a spectacular coincidence? I'd like to know the science behind it if it's true!!  I plan on carbing up later tonight and it'll be interesting to see if my pain comes back in the morning.

Thanks!"

Hi all, I've been doing the carnivore diet pretty strict since March 2020 (7 months). Loving it and have never felt as good. 27yo male, 65kg 1.69cm

Today I went to donate blood and in the screening test I got turned down because my  white blood cells were too low. They wanted 4.8 /micro liter and I had 4.7. All other markers were fine.  the doctor said that if this level persisted over the next months I should seek medical attention ( don't know if I should pay too much attention to him) .

Anyway just wanted to check in with you guys because I'm curious to know if anybody else had experienced this  in their blood work since starting the carnivore diet or if anybody has an idea if this could be related to meat only diet. My diet is roughly 50% pork, 40 % beef and 10 % eggs, chicken, fish. I was thinking that maybe it could be related to a vitamin C deficiency, but that would be odd seeing as the last two days I've had beef liver for dinner. 

Of course completely open to the idea that it has absolutely nothing to do with my diet. THANKS!"

There is usually a fattier cut of all three and is usually around 5-9 a pound depending on the cut.

Anyways, I just swish them in boiling water, pan fry, or bake them. Super tasty and tender since they’re usually fatty and thin!

If you’re curious: most Asian countries have a hot pot style meal where there is a boiling pot of seasoned soup/broth in the middle of the table, with a lot of raw ingredients around it. You just take your chopsticks, grab a raw ingredient and swish it around the pot then out in mouth. Excellent. Saves prep, cook, and cleanup time!"

zerocarb,"Some advice for a German university freshman just starting out? I‘ve just moved out from my parents a few weeks ago and with my newfound freedom I wanted to try changing up my diet.

It took a while to convince myself of the carnivore diet since I grew up in poverty and I‘d likely triple or quadruple my food expenses, even buying the cheapest meat I can find but I‘ve got quite a few troubles which might change for the better on a healthier diet, so I‘m giving it a shot despite the cost. Sadly, I only have a tiny freezer, so I can’t really buy in bulk when there are sales.

Since I‘m living off governmental support I have to make every cent count, so I plan on using up my two days worth of remaining carbs before switching to ground meat and eggs, maybe some liver as well, since I enjoy the taste, it‘s cheap, and might help balance out the nutritional deficiencies of cheap meat. Although, I guess it‘s gonna be more of a plain ketogenic diet at first since I have some sunflower and olive oil left to finish off as well. I know they‘re less healthy than animal fats but I paid good money for them and I hate throwing away food. I‘ve also eaten food fried in margarine for my whole life, so I don‘t think those two bottles of oil are gonna cause much more harm.


A few questions:

Is it fine to exclusively eat (non-processed) cheap meat without running into nutritional deficiencies down the road? From what I could gather, even organic (which I can‘t afford anyways) meat is not necessarily grass fed/finished in Germany but I think they‘re supplementing animals with minerals/vitamins.

Can I eat mostly pork and chicken without running into nutritional deficiencies since beef is pretty expensive over here?

I have a small kitchen (two stove plates, no oven, one small pan, one small cooking pot):
What are some cheap meats/meals that can be cooked within those limitations?

What additional kitchen supplies should I get? (I‘m not allowed to get an oven or additional stove plates due to dorm guidelines But things like a small grill would be fine.)

How much should I worry about the fat:protein ratio and when people speak of two thirds fat vs one protein, are they referring to weight or calories? The ground pork I get over here is exactly 50:50 when comparing weight.

What are some cheap ways of adding animal fat to meat/eggs?

Edit: should I buy iodized or regular salt?


Thanks in advance and feel free to leave any advice that isn‘t related to the above questions as I‘m grateful for any help I can get."

opens up discussing proportion of plants which are inedible compared to proportion of animals ...

(just started listening will update as it goes along)

pluses &amp; minuses, functions of oxidative stress, while focusing on antioxidant effect of plants, we are forgetting about side effects of molecular hormesis, egs sulforaphane, isothiocyanates

can be beneficial because turns on antioxidant response system but there are many negatives, lists some of the harms from sulforaphane, isothiocyanate. it's a consistent pattern w plant molecules, over and over again.

is benefit worth risk? he would argue no, risk is not worth benefit because you can use other strategems, environmental strategems -- cold water shower/swim/bathing, sauna, exercise) for benefits of hormesis without the side effects of the plant compounds.

Joe asks about cats says they go for gut first. had impression Saladino seemed unfamiliar with this.  (I will point out here that that is not always the case and will update with ref from wildlife biologist in a sec, since some cats avoid. ETA: eg ""Cheetahs try to avoid the stomach and its contents most of the time, but if they are really hungry or the gazelle is really small, it all gets eaten.

Saladino - animal foods nutritionally complete. no nutrients in plants that you cannot get from animal foods. many in animal foods that do not occur in plants -- eg B12, vitamin K2, choline, carnitine, taurine.

(Joe, what about vitamin C?) Saladino: Can def get vitamin C, liver, heart, muscle, it all has vitamin C. For needed quantities, Saladino references a study from the 1930s-early 1940s, where they experiemented with doses of vitamin C to determine minimum requirement to avoid scurvy. 10mg/day.  (screenshot of title and 1st page at 16m53s, [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510534/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510534/) since paper is behind a paywall, this thread has more screenshots,  https://twitter.com/MatthewJDalby/status/1320336702435696640?s=20 )

discussion about whether more is beneficial. anecdotal, yes, some association with vitamin C in the blood and outcomes. but when do interventional studies don't confirm the association. no improvement mortatlity, common cold, cardiovascular, blood pressure.

metabolic dysfunction decreases the level of vitamin C in our body.

moving onto getting more from organs.Saladino says this will give around RDA, 70mg a day. Joe mentions eating nose to tail. Saladino recounts an anecdote he heard from Steve Rinella when he was with him.

Saladino repeats the trope that all indigenous cultures do it, that really they savour the organs above all other things.

\[this is not true. it's a strategy employed to deal with the nutrient availability in their environment. some groups up north with consistent food availability would toss the liver to the dogs. during harvest season, other groups south of the arctic, would catch and store certain parts (fat, muscle meats) and leave the rest for other animals. but during a year where there was a phase of food scarcity, they would eat more nose to tail -- eg when eating smaller mammals or fowl.  other groups did do as Saladino said, but in no way all groups and in no way all the time.\]

The anecdote was that the trappers got sick because they weren't eating the organs. \[worth noting that trappers also would have included some storage foods and did some preserving of their meats, the former raising their vitamin C requirements, the latter decreasing or erasing the vitamin C content in the meat.\]

\*\*\*

want to take this moment to point out that not everyone can do what Saladino has done. and frankly, it's annoying that he doesn't seem to understand this basic point.

Either they are so sensitive to carbohydrates that they will start rapidly increasing their adipose tissue in response to fruit, honey -- even in small amounts.  and that there are people who are doing this for health reasons who will respond poorly to those foods -- for food intolerance reasons &amp;/or because the higher insulin and BG isn't helpful for their autoimmune or health condition.

this subreddit is maintained for people who need to and want to do zerocarb &amp; how to troubleshoot it if you need to completely avoid carbohydrates.

\*\*\*

omg, now he's moving onto the 'we are eating less sugar, so it's not the reason for the current increase in obesity' canard. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️

okay, just as a supposition: let's say that the problematic level is 40-60lbs per year.

Consumption rose to 100lbs/person and then decreased to 80lbs.  --&gt; people are eating less sugar, but it's still a problematic level.

But even worse, when you add in what has happened to the people who ate a lot of sugar and now can't even handle starches or sugar, &amp; for them, even small amounts of sugar are a problem, let alone 80lbs/year. In order to avoid increasing their fat stores and/or keep their T2D into remission, they need to avoid those completely.

For a population in the 1930s or 1940s, the ones who were eating at or under the hypothetical problematic 40-60lbs/year level,  most might be fine on average for most of their life, with some getting what used to be called 'adult onset diabetes'. By contrast, a population in the current age, who went through the very high consumption phase can't even tolerate small amounts without gain &amp;/or without their prediabetes proceeding to T2D, or without their T2D coming out of remission.

This means: You can't say to the current population, ""most people used to be fine eating 40-60lbs of sugar a year! you're going to be fine doing the same!"" you need to factor in their response to having had a higher level of sugar for most of their life.

there are other probs with his 'it's not the sugar' argument but will leave it at that for now.

It's as if he's trying to extrapolate from his own experience (""honey and fruit is fine for me! sugar can't be bad!"") to the general case.

I however just got back from the grocery store and probably stood there for a solid 3 minutes debating buying a pack of Mortadella that was on sale and looked absolutely delicious, ingredients were, pork, pork fat, salt and sugar with 0 carbs per serving (from my understanding it still could be 0.9g).

It’s a bit expensive for how much food it really is.  I know it is a good source of vitamin K2.  It is 60 day aged raw milk cheddar.   But also grass fed butter and the other foods have enough vitamin K2 ? Not really finding clear answers anywhere.  I want to cut for costs but will keep it if it’s really giving me something the other foods aren’t, besides salt.  And besides that it’s delicious.  All input greatly appreciated.  Thanks peeps."
zerocarb,"cooked weight and raw fat.  

Before someone comments, ""You shouldn't count, eat fat to satiety."" I am, but this is out of curiosity.

I buy fat trimmings from the butcher. If I heat the fat a lot renders off. If I use 100g in the pan (raw weight) The cooked weight is then somewhere around 60-70 g fat. When people say 2:1 fat and protein, would you count the 100g raw weight or the 60-70g cooked weight? I'm not using any of the rendered fat for eating, only for cooking."
zerocarb,"Slow cooked pork butt: https://imgur.com/gallery/itAAXBx


1) Preheat oven to 250F.

2) Take a 5 pound pork butt and season with whatever you want. 

3) Cover pork butt with lid, place in oven.

4) 6 hours later, remove pork butt from oven

5) Take two forks and shred pork butt, mix with all the delicious rendered fat. 

6) Serve with some cheese and sour cream. 

Pork butt is very fatty so this is an easy way to hit a 1:1 protein fat ratio without needing to add any extra fat. Also very easy meal to make. I stick mine in at 8am and it's ready by lunch at 2pm. Enjoy!"

With that being said, I don't generally track anything, but lately I've kept a loose track on my fat vs protein intake. I don't think I'm getting enough fat. Now, I can't eat fatty beef cuts every day, like ribeyes, but I attempt to cook with a lot of butter to try to get extra fat in. I know bacon has a lot of fat, but most of the bacon I find is cured with sugar, which I want to avoid at all costs. 

I looked online for fat bomb recipes, but most of them are keto based, which uses artificial sweetners, which I also want to avoid. Any good tips or tricks for bumping up the fat intake?"

full cholesterol panel 

c-reactive protein

various vitamin levels, maybe D and B12 (what else?)

zerocarb,"Supplements on Carnivore Diet? Opinions... Hi, I know a lot of long time carnivores say that you don't need supplements on the carnivore diet and that you can get all your complete nutrients from meat and offal, but what about people with specific higher requirements of certain nutrients. People who deal with chronic stress, IBS or drink coffee might have different nutritional needs than others.

For example I find taking vitamin c, zinc, lysine and eating pure gelatin has helped improve my symptoms on carnivore. Maybe I have trouble absorbing vitamin c or zinc from my food or I was suffering a zinc deficiency due to chronic stress and excess coffee consumption, either way taking these supplements have helped me.

I used to take lysine before this diet and it helped me heal faster after a skin flareup and gelatin as well."

I've posted this website a few times after redesigning it a few months ago, and I just wanted to let you know about all the content that exists in it - as I've been burning the whale oil at 2 am working on it. I posted this same post [https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/j83eox/quick\_overview\_of\_the\_content\_on\_my\_ketoscience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/j83eox/quick_overview_of_the_content_on_my_ketoscience/) but with images in case you want to see those.

# Purpose

* [justmeat.co](https://justmeat.co) is a great website for quick access to great info, but I wanted more functionality - @bitstein made that - give him props!
* [www.carniway.nyc](https://www.carniway.nyc) is a wix website with databases and way more features - It's easy to add and change content.
* Make a way to take source data and put it into a searchable, ordered data set that we can use as a knowledge base.
* Explain not just why science is the way it is today - but how perspectives develop over time. How bias exists - what ideas were available to people. Also to show how little has changed - the same wars have been fought for millenia.
* Give a way for the average person to get acquainted with the full scale of history and research in as little time as possible - no matter where they are (website &gt; book), and easy to share and discuss.
* The idea is to start at the beginning - and just keep learning!
* Have another place to put information other than r/ketoscience and r/zerocarb wikis - and have our own customized data that's better than Title + Text + Flair.
* I love criticism and it's helped make this site better. If you like it too and want to help, let me know. I can add pages that allow the addition of data from other trusted members, or I can just pull data out of reddit comments if you help organize the needed information. Accurate text, good links, accurate date, etc. A great way to do this might be to submit a new post here with your content and tag me with a comment that you want it added. Your wish = my command.
* If I'm missing content - let me know.

# All History (the best one first)

I currently have 432 entries in my history database - [https://www.carniway.nyc/all-history](https://www.carniway.nyc/all-history) I basically read old books and science and medical  journals to find the real quotes and then typed them out or copied them as best I could. I wanted to have a good source to build arguments off of - all in one place. These entries concern the last 2,000 years - I have another database based on the B.C.E. history, which will reach into the millions of years.

Features:

* Click Backwards or Forwards to order the collection dates.
* Click Recently Added to see what I do at 1 am when I'm adding entries.
* Click some of the Selection tags at the top (one at a time) to filter the collection based on those tags. Most entries have 2-4 tags, for whatever it is relevant to.
* Most of the posts have a url - you can click it, but not many have pdfs.
* Open the comment button's link in a new tab to see a bigger image, a dedicated link you can share, and you can post....Facebook comments. (maybe I'll add different commenting on feedback)
* EX: [https://www.carniway.nyc/history/fernando-grosso-meatheals-story](https://www.carniway.nyc/history/fernando-grosso-meatheals-story)
* Use the search - it seems to work pretty well.

# Ancient History

[https://www.carniway.nyc/ancient-history](https://www.carniway.nyc/ancient-history) \- This database is small and brand new. Want to help? I'm going to need it. Best evidence for carnivory - distinct dates - reliable sources.

# Ethnography

60 tribes, with effort to understand how carnivorous they are. High def images, recipes, meat info, plant info, and even how industrialization has changed them (usually for the negative). The possibilities are endless in terms of adding information to this.

# Book Recommendations

So this was the first Database I made, and it was all because of another list I made for r/ketoscience 3 years ago in 2017!

Here's one particular book I just read a month ago, Kabloona- I also added several entries to my history database so that the important details are recorded. See how useful that might be? I will probably also add better linking between events and books, so you can see all the entries from history that belong to a book.

# Plantinutrients

Kind of an in-progress database that could use a lot more research (hint, hint - help me out!) and UI polish - I'm trying to log specific molecules in plants that might have a deleterious effect on animals. There's also a food database repeater at the bottom.

# Caveats :

* This is a wix website with databases and code. I can make changes in minutes - so if you have requests - let me know. Mobile and Desktop are slightly different - I suggest reading them on desktop.
* I was also thinking about monetizing this website earlier, and then decided to strip that out and keep it dedicated to my passion: finding this stuff. Maybe I should open a Patreon? What do you think?
* And also - how would you want to see this information presented in a book - if one were to be written?
* There's also a variety of other wiki like pages with images and videos - you can see those in the header and navigate there yourself. They are at least as good if not better than our wikis here. My plan is to go through them again and add relevant stuff to the other databases.
* I also made these links to be shareable - so share them! Post them on reddit if you want - they're meant to be ways to prompt a discussion - a little ""I didn't know that! Why didn't I know that? Click Next.""
* I also just indexed it on Google so it should be easier to search all this stuff.

zerocarb,"Limited to Beef, Lamb and salt. No organ meats... I've found I can eliminate most of my digestion and skin issues by avoid sugars and veggies and only eating meat, but even half of carnivore diet foods cause problems with me.

Carnivore foods that i can't eat-

Pork(severe skin reaction)

Dairy(severe skin reaction)

Clams and mussels(immediate nausea)

Chicken and eggs (minor inflammatory reaction)

Seafood (occasional reaction, usually headaches and itchy nose)

Tallow and Liver (histamine issues and skin reactions)

&amp;#x200B;

So far I find i can tolerate some seafood. Only organ meat i haven't reacted so far to is chicken hearts (update if i do)

It is for this reason I usually stick to beef and lamb but due to this I find I have a hard time upping my fat intake. I'm wondering if anybody is in the same boat as I am right now when it comes to severe restrictions on this diet..."

zerocarb,"Inflammatory Reaction to Grassfed Ghee I suspected I was lactose or casein intolerant when I went on carnivore diet and had a reduction in inflammatory skin reactions. I started eating ghee since it is supposed to be fine for those who are lactose/casein intolerant since the milk solids are removed. I tried it since i have what seems like a histamine reaction when eating tallow and i thought i wasn't getting enough fat intake in my diet.

I tried eating it the first time and broke out (blamed it on horomones since i was on my period at the time) 

Second time I started suffering extreme nausea and had the worst breakout i've had in a while. Its been almost two weeks now and my skin is still freaking out! 

To those who are seriously lactose/casein intollerant, be careful with ghee it is still possible to have an allergic reaction after continuous consumption."

zerocarb,Fat trimming quality I picked up 3 pounds of beef trimmings from my local butcher and have been frying it up with my chuck roasts to get more fat.

I’ve just heard that the fat contains most of the toxins and quality is of upmost importance. Thanks!

zerocarb,"Just finished transcribing/lating from French to English all 73 individual case studies on the use of the all meat carnivore diet to ""cure"" type 2 diabetes in 1870's Italy. The rigorous all-meat treatment was used by Dr Cantani and Dr Primavera, who believed that it worked for every single patient! How my weekend went: my fiancee went to a party and I had two free days to really focus on my database (I also had an OMAD steak dinner with my dad last night)....

I just read half of this old 500 page French textbook on diabetes written by Dr Cantani. He suggested his patients eat an all meat diet, and he claims to have cured 125 patients in this book. He took detailed notes and scientific measures for his patients, and he asked them about their diets - noting that all of them were eating starchy bread and pasta, sugary treats and candy, and even fruit. I went through a translated version on babeltrust after coming across him while researching for my carnivore database - and then copied text into my database - the format of their website is really annoying and there were a lot of mistakes or repeats - so I really hope to make this information available to the public for the first time in an easy to digest format.

&amp;#x200B;

Read these four first - It seems Cantani was quite a guy. Then when you're still skeptical - read the case reports below.

The following links are individual links for all 73 case stories. None of them is particularly longer than the other, except for case 73. The first 13 are individual - the rest are grouped up into larger groups of about 10 entries.

zerocarb,"Frequent Nighttime Urination 24 M 6 2' 195 lbs

Been doing Carnivore again for a couple of months and my sleep hasn't been the same. I wake up a couple of times a night to go take a piss. I eat 1 to 2 meals a day to satiation. Mostly ground beef 20-25 percent fat ratio, though it becomes hard to consume any significant amount of beef if the fat is 25% but I can eat a metric shit ton if it's 12-15%. I lay down the salt on it and supplement it with Vit D, k2, chelated Magnesium, and melatonin. I'm fairly active. It's not uncommon for me to work out 2 times a day in addition to work but still get up sometime in the night.  

I looked up other posts in the past and it seems to be a common problem for others as well. Unfortunately, there didn't appear to be any clear answers. Does anyone have advice for me? I'm only doing this diet for skin-related issues and it seems to be doing alright in that regard, but I haven't really noticed any massive energy spikes or other stuff many people claim here."
zerocarb,"Anyone who has healed psoriasis with ZC? I've been eating mostly ZC for the last 2-3 months (with some small exceptions here and there), and been feeling great. I always skip breakfast and usually only eat between 1 - 2pm and 8 pm.

Apart from some reduced energy while running (probably due to lack of glycogen build up in muscles) almost all changes have been beneficial. Social gatherings are the downside mostly.

One of the main reasons I tried this WOE is because I wanted to get rid (or at least alleviate) my psoriasis, but the condition didn't get much better. Also the fact that the weather has gotten quite a bit colder in the last two months might play a role, but I'm curious about the experience of others.

I may be reading too much into this but I just had 6 eggs and some bacon as I usually do for my first meal and today I was really thirsty so I drank more water than I usually do with my meals and my stomach has been making weird noises and kinda cramping since . Does anyone here limit water when eating ?
zerocarb,Red vs White meat Recently watched Steve Rimmer video on swapping to chicken and did a bit of a diet recall on this and found it to be rather true. Do you guys find that with white meat (even fattier ones) were easier to overeat compared to red meat? Just something i find myself noticing when eating say pork belly vs a fatty cut of steak. Might be nutrient density at play here. Any thoughts of wisdom from experts or anyone else feel the same way?

zerocarb,"No cravings for fat trimmings and they make me nauseated, temporary or a sign that I shouldn't eat so much fat? 5 months pure carnivore I've been trying to add beef fat trimmings to my diet for a few days now and I find it difficult to eat fat no matter how I prepare it. Is this just something I'll eventually get used to or a sign I shouldn't be eating more fat? I wanted to add more fat in response to recently lowered energy levels. I never tracked macros but I was always eating on the leaner side due to the types of steaks I had access to. Maybe I'm not as fat adapted as I thought since I'm so averse to fat? I never even really craved it, just sought out the fattiest chuck roasts I could find because I knew I needed it."
zerocarb,"Has anyone here tried this animal based WOE for 30+ days and NOT have positive results? Genuinely curious. I see lots of positive posts but I am wondering if someone tried this and did not notice any changes, had negative changes or did not feel anything  different than what they felt with a keto diet."
zerocarb,"Social stigma around diet Hi guys, I live in a fat with 6 other people and we share a kitchen. They eat meat themselfs, but they also eta rice, pasta, vegetable etc. I can definitely tell they think im wired. This is partly because I always go to room to eat but I also think it's because I only ever eat or drink steak, bacon, eggs, salmon and milk, lots of milk.

zerocarb,"My home smells like a steak house I enjoy cooking all my meat in a frying pan, because I get a good sear/crust on the outside, keep the inside raw/rare, and keep most of the fat of the meat intact. This way of cooking is fine in the summer, but not in the winter when all of my windows are closed because my home smells like a steak house.

\- I tried a small grill/toaster oven, but I can't get a good sear and I end up with dry meat and too much liquid fat, because most of the fat is cooked out of the meat.

\- I tried an air fryer, but a lot of the fat is lost as well, and it was really harder to clean than just cleaning the frying pan.

Has anyone found the perfect way to cook meat in the winter? If so, what kind of cooking method &amp; model do you use?"

The Carnivore Diet: What You Need to Know

This very restrictive diet is a meat lover’s special.

By Elaine K. Howley, Contributor Sept. 28, 2020
This article is based on reporting that features expert sources.

U.S. News &amp; World Report

HUMANS HAVE EVOLVED THE ability to digest all manner of food items, from fruits and vegetables to animal products. Debate continues about what constitutes the best ratio of various types of food to support optimal human health, but a new entrant into the diet scene suggests that all plants are suspect and we should embrace an animal-only diet for improved physical well-being.

This so-called carnivore diet is a “zero-carbohydrate diet and an extreme version of the keto diet,” says Hollie Zammit, a registered dietitian with Orlando Health in Orlando, Florida.

This approach to eating encourages consuming only animal protein, which proponents say can help you avoid or reverse common ailments such as diabetes, obesity and autoimmune diseases.

Dr. Paul Saladino, an integrative medicine and nutritional biochemistry practitioner in private practice in San Diego and author of “The Carnivore Code: Unlocking the Secrets to Optimal Health by Returning to our Ancestral Diet,” is a staunch proponent of the carnivore diet and says going carnivore is the solution to a range of health issues plaguing humankind. Plants, he says, simply aren’t cutting it.

“If you look at the incidence of chronic disease, no one can deny that in the last 70 years, we’ve become abysmally unhealthy,” Saladino says. “Rates of obesity and overweight are 70% of the U.S. population. Diabetes has gone from 0.9% or 1% to 13% or 14%. And that’s just diagnosed diabetes, not pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome. Chronic disease now impacts 40% of the population. Fifty or 60 years ago it was 10% or 15%. So the question is, what the heck happened?”

He continues, noting that we’re drinking less alcohol, smoking less and exercising more, and yet we still get sicker. “Unhealthy behaviors have gone way down. And if you look at the number of people who are eating ‘healthfully,’ that’s gone way up. But that’s just according to the U.S. dietary guidelines.”

What’s happening is a good question, and according to Saladino, the answer is that “we’re doing some things that are incompatible with our genetics and evolutionary history that are causing us to get sick.” Namely, eating plants. “Having more vegetables and eating less red meat, we’re getting sicker and sicker.”

He notes that red meat bears the blame for many ailments and chronic diseases, and he thinks this is backward. Plants, he says, are varying levels of toxic to humans, hence why so many of them are poisonous and even some of the ones we can eat, such as beans, must first be must be carefully prepared and cooked to remove toxic proteins. “It’s not a question of if plants are toxic, it’s a question of how toxic any one plant is and how well any individual or animal can detoxify what’s in there,” he says.

By contrast, he notes that “animals don’t have toxins in their body with a few rare exceptions of a small frog in the Amazon and puffer fish liver. But generally speaking, 99.9% of animal organs are all edible by humans. And in fact, it’s incredibly nutritious food and basically what we’ve been thriving on for two to four million years.”

The Carnivore Diet

For meat eaters who are interested in trying the carnivore approach to eating, you’ll have to cut out all plant foods. Yes, really. The goal is to eliminate all carbohydrates, and Saladino says that save for the odd berry or other seasonal fruit our carnivore ancestors would pick up while hunting game, plants are not on the menu.

“It works as an elimination diet by slowly reducing intake of carbohydrates and plant-based food items and increasing intake of animal protein,” Zammit explains. “Oftentimes on an elimination diet, food items may be slowly reintroduced, but that’s not the case here. The ultimate goal is 100% intake of animal-based protein.”

Followers of the diet are instructed to eat any kind of meat and meat product, from fatty cuts of beef, lamb, pork and organ meats, as well as poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products. “Think a 4-ounce ribeye, two eggs and bacon cooked in butter for breakfast, 3 ounces of salmon and 6 ounces of shrimp for lunch. Then 2 ounces of liver and 8 ounces of filet for dinner. There’s no flexibility for a bun on your burger or a piece of fruit for dessert,” Zammit says.

The reason for this very restrictive emphasis on animal protein is simple, Saladino explains. “Animal meat and organs are the most nutrient-rich and bioavailable foods on the planet. They’ve been incredibly vilified for the last 60 years, but they’re an integral part of every healthy human diet.”

It's true that organ meats are highly nutritious, being rich sources of B vitamins, several minerals including iron, magnesium and zinc, and fat-soluble vitamins including vitamins A, D, E and K. Organ meat and animal meat in general contain high levels of protein. And it's true that our hunter-gatherer ancestors ate every part of the animals they hunted, nose to tail.

The idea with this approach is to be as animal-based as possible, as opposed to plant-based. Plant-based diets such as the Mediterranean diet have long been favored by most dietitians and doctors as the healthiest and most sustainable way for humans to eat for longevity and wellness. But the carnivore diet turns that conventional and well-established advice on its head.

Health Claims

Saladino claims that the carnivore diet can be the source of healing for virtually any autoimmune or chronic disease you might be experiencing, from depression and rheumatoid arthritis to diabetes, acne and obesity.

While the diet is extreme, it may result in weight loss. Because the diet is high in fat, it will “promote meal satiety,” meaning that “you’ll feel fuller longer,” Zammit says, which can lead to weight loss. “Feeling satiated from consuming these food items can help reduce your caloric intake, as you won’t feel as hungry, likely leading to weight loss.”

There’s also some evidence that suggests excessive sugar intake can alter brain chemistry, which could contribute to the development of depression. Cutting back on sugar and processed carbs may improve mood, as has been observed with the keto diet in some studies. As an extreme form of keto, there’s an argument to be made that the carnivore diet might also confer some mood-boosting benefits.

Reducing your intake of carbohydrates may also help with blood glucose control, which may be helpful for people with diabetes. Some studies have also noted that the keto diet can reduce inflammation in the brain and body, which may also help with diabetes and other chronic medical conditions.

Zammit also notes that for some people with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, symptoms such as bloating and flatulence may also decline because you’ll be consuming far fewer FODMAPs, a type of carbohydrate that can cause gastrointestinal distress in some people.

Saladino says there’s lots of scientific research to back up claims about the superiority of the carnivore diet, but Zammit cautions against confusing anecdotal support with scientific understanding. “This diet demonizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds, while promoting claims of improving fatigue, digestion and autoimmune diseases,” Zammit explains. “These claims are not based on sound science, but rather anecdotal reports.”

Health Risks

Eliminating all food groups from your diet except one is not a risk-free endeavor. As such, Zammit says “there’s a lot to unfold here. But since I’m an oncology dietitian, let’s start with cancer risk.”

It’s long been established that plant-based diets may help ward off cancer. “We have strong evidence from several meta-analytical studies that demonstrate a plant-based diet can greatly reduce your risk of several cancer types, as well as other disease states, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes,” Zammit says.

Similarly, “it’s well-known that a diet heavy in red and processed meats can increase risk of stomach and colorectal cancer. We also know that a diet rich in saturated fat can increase risk of liver cancer,” Zammit explains.

Another potential concern with the carnivore diet is the risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, “which is caused by the accumulation of saturated fat. This isn’t always reversible by changing your diet,” Zammit says. “When we have this buildup of saturated fat, it can cause inflammation of the liver, increasing the risk of liver cancer.

Beyond cancer risk, people with heart issues should also use caution when considering a carnivore diet. “If you have a personal or family history of cardiovascular disease and hyperlipidemia, the carnivore diet is not for you,” Zammit says.


The diet is also a poor choice for people with chronic kidney disease, even if they aren’t on dialysis. “With chronic kidney disease, you’re instructed to actually limit your protein intake,” she explains.

“The average protein needs of a healthy individual are 40 to 65 grams per day. When you have CKD, your kidneys no longer have the ability to remove protein wastes, which will then buildup in the blood and can cause a whole host of unpleasant symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite and weakness,” Zammit says.

Because the carnivore diet is bereft of all plant matter, you won’t be taking in much or any fiber. “Due to the lack of fiber, most people will end up with constipation,” Zammit says. (For his part, Saladnio says humans don’t need fiber, and he calls it “one of the greatest cons ever foisted upon humans.” He says we don’t need fiber to digest animal products, and it causes more GI distress than it alleviates.)

“There’s also an increased risk of malnourishment, since you would no longer be consuming a balanced diet,” Zammit says. In particular, “vitamin C would be lacking, increasing risk of scurvy,” a disease that was common among sailors in the 18th century and causes swollen and bleeding gums, anemia, loss of teeth, weakness and poor healing of wounds. It can be deadly.

“In addition to all the medical and nutritional issues one may encounter on a carnivore diet, there’s also the psychological aspect of following a restrictive diet,” that you need to consider before you adopt this approach to nutrition, Zammit says. “Following any restrictive diet can often lead to loneliness and social isolation. It can build distrust with yourself, disconnecting the relationship you have with your body and food. All this can affect your quality of life in a negative way, especially if following long term.” As such, if you have a history of eating disorders, you’d be well advised to avoid this diet.

How Much Does It Cost?

Typically, meat products cost more than plant-based foods, and as such, “you may have to shell out more money than you realize to follow this diet,” Zammit says. “Although you won’t be spending money on the food items you used to include, you’ll make up for it and then some by having to purchase animal protein for all your meals.”

This cost is compounded by the fact that the diet encourages only using “grass-fed and ethically-sourced protein, which is very expensive, and not everyone has the privilege to obtain, depending on their neighborhood and socioeconomic status,” she says.

Diet and Health

Lastly, Zammit notes, it’s important to “keep in mind, that when it comes to your overall health, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. Genetics, age and gender play a huge role in how your body reacts to certain food items or diets, and this isn’t something we can change.”

She also warns about being careful when comparing yourself to other people. “The human body is incredibly complex. There are no ‘bad’ foods, just bad overall diets. Behavior and lifestyle modification are still the best predictors of your health and happiness. At the end of the day, nourish your body based on your individual needs and preferences.”

She also recommends that if you’re thinking of beginning a particular diet, “please contact your local registered dietitian to help educate and guide you.”

For his part, Saladino, who is a devout follower of the carnivore diet, says he’s never felt better since adopting this lifestyle, and he encourages those who feel the need to make some changes to check it out.

“If you’re kicking ass in every way, shape and form, then don’t change a thing. But if you’re looking to improve body composition, libido, emotional stability, mental clarity, autoimmunity, inflammation, chronic disease, I’m so excited to offer these ideas as a tool for people who might not have considered them because we’re so stuck in this rigid paradigm around plants versus animals. It’s a diet for every homo sapiens person that isn’t thriving.”

zerocarb,"So I've Gotten Into ""Nutrition Density"" as of Recent.. ..and figured who better to [share a picture of my dinner with than you fine folks!](https://imgur.com/anXCbaZ)

Meal consisted of pan seared wild sockeye salmon, six pastured eggs, cooked in grass-fed butter and salmon drippings and topped with a raw milk/probiotic cheese that I've fallen in love with!

Bowl in the upper left is bone marrow, the bone marrow gets put on both the eggs and salmon and then the salmon gets all mixed up with the eggs and it becomes one giant mess of deliciousness!

In the upper right bowl we have a can of oysters, which I restricted myself to only eating about a 3rd of today (tons of zinc and I had a 1.5lb beef heart for lunch).

I've actually made this exact same dish twice now in the last 5 days it's that good.  Warning:  straight up nutritional food-buzz vibes will and do occur upon completion of said meal should any of you here be so venturous as to try to duplicate!  ;)"
zerocarb,"Question For The Athletes I was wondering if anyone who plays a high-intensity sport, like Football (a.k.a. Soccer), has a specific routine that they follow when approaching training/games.

For instance, with a more typical western diet, it might be recommended to stock up on carbs the night before a game, have a banana hours before kickoff and maybe some sweets at half-time etc.

I basically want to play my best football whilst avoiding any 'messy' issues on the pitch. 

So, do you have a Zero Carb routine that suits you both for performance and comfort?"
zerocarb,"Stefansson in 1918 while sick with typhoid and about to die: ""I was allowed to eat one of my favorite foods, frozen raw fish. This seemed to do me good, and my second day out from Herschel saw me free of fever."" ""It was now Fry's opinion that I had had typhoid fever. When my friends thought of what they had been letting me eat, they were shocked and alarmed. During the first period of high fever I had been without appetite, but as soon as the fever dropped to 100 degrees, I had begun to eat steaks and fried potatoes or whatever else the police were having for their meals. An hour before my sudden relapse, I had eaten a large meal of macaroni and cheese. There were some who believed that this heavy food was responsible. The relapse, they felt, served me right. What eles could have been expected of a sick man who ate macaroni and cheese!""

page 208

""My convalescence was not going well. When it was decided that I must have had typhoid, I was put on the orthodox typhoid diet. Nothing but tinned and Argentitian powdered milk was available. My belief was that if I was allowed to eat the hearty foods for which I hungered I would probably have a better chance of getting well, and I used to reason elaborately and, it seemed to me, convincingly that I should be allowed a chance at a square meal. Arguments that seemed lucid to me were, unfortunately, considered the cunning of delirium.""

page 209

""My condition kept growing worse. Finally, everyone agreed that I was going to die. At that point Police Inspector Phillips took the position that, if I was going to die, I might as well die as I wanted: in an effort to get to Fort Yukon. This did not meet the views of some of the others. There was at Herschel Island a very respectable graveyard where whalers and other white men had been buried with supposedly civilized pomp and circumstance. I felt sure that, if I died, there would be a thoroughly orthodox funeral. However, I preferred to die elsewhere and, if possible, later.""

""It was in the first week of April, 1918, that I left Herschel Island in a sled equipped with springs from an old cot. Constable Brockie, Henry Fry, my Indian teen-ager, and two Eskimos accompanied me.

Fry, now that we were away from the settlement, was less inclined to insist on the orthodox liquid diet for a typhoid convalescent. I was allowed to eat one of my favorite foods, frozen raw fish. This seemed to do me good, and my second day out from Herschel saw me free of fever. It seemed unnecessary for Fry to continue with us. He said that, since I apparently got along better the more my conduct differed from what his medical books said it ought to be, I might as well take the entire responsibility for doing as I liked. Having come to this conclusion, he returned to his mission at Herschel Island. 

From then on, my breakfasts and suppers consisted of caribou and fish, sometimes frozen and raw, sometimes cooked. I felt better each day and regained weight until finally, when we arrived at the mouth of the Old Crow River, at the trading post of Schultz and Johnson, I was no longer in real need of the expert care that I could get from Mrs. Schultz, who before her marriage had been a trained nurse at Fort Yukon. While I did not need the care, I shall never forget the kindness of Mrs. Schultz and her husband."" 

Page 210

On April 27th, when we arrived at St. Stephen's Hospital, Fort Yukon, I was so far recovered that I walked without assistance from the gate to the house. A month before, when I had been about to leave Herschel, Inspector Philips had had to guide my hand as I made the penciled cross by which I agreed that if I died on the journey the responsibility would be my own. Thus, my polar expedition came to an end.""

I’m getting a lot more fat from pork than I am from beef and I never feel an upset stomach or nauseous. However, take today for instance, I didn’t have any pork belly so I just ate the chuck steak and eggs. Shortly afterwards I felt very nauseous, I can feel my heart beating harder like how you feel if you overeat on the standard American diet, kind of a cloudy head, just an overall uncomfortable feeling.  A similar thing happened to me a few weeks ago when I made a big beef brisket. I slow cooked it for 24 hours and it was delicious. However shortly after eating it I noticed that I got extremely nauseous. I thought maybe it was just coincidence, so the next day I had some more and the same reaction.

zerocarb,"Eating fatback I'm experimenting with zero carb after coming across Paul Saladino on the MeatEater podcast. The struggle for me is fat : protein ratio. Most of my meat intake before this was venison, which is extemely lean. I have been eating farmed meats to get the fats up to around 70% of calories (counted using cronometer app) but it's hard work. I bought a big bag of pork fatback to help address that but I need some help with cooking it. 

I have used fatback for sausage making before (and might make some pemmican) but I'm hoping there's a way to just cook and eat a slab of it. I tried slicing and pan-frying like a lean-free bacon but by the time it looked cooked to me, 80% of it (measured) had rendered out.

Related question, is there a convenient way to consume rendered fat when there's no bread to spread it on or vegies to saute in it or schnitzel to fry in it? I use a bit when I cook meat but of course with fatty meat, more renders out than soaks in, in general."

zerocarb,"Increase in fat resulting in Diarrhea; just see it through? Hello, just in need of some clearing up on some stuff I’ve been looking at. I’ll just preface this with some background, I’ve been carnivore for somewhere around 1.5-2 years, initially trying to fix digestive issues. 

To my question, every time I increase fat I encounter Diarrhea akin to the descriptions found with bile acid malabsorption (this was present more consistently prior to carnivore). This has deterred me in the past, assuming it was some sort of inflammatory response, consequently dropping the fat again and whatever I was eating at the time. 

After looking at old posts and a few other places I get the impression this is something I may need to just see through. Can anyone who has experienced similar symptoms help me out as it’s been pretty miserable over the last week, since introducing more fat (toilet hours are racking up).

Just for context I feel the need to increase my fat in take because I’m starting to feel hungry all the time again, weight gain has stopped (I was very underweight when I started) and I generally feel better  with higher fat (excluding digestive issues)."

zerocarb,"Can I expect more rapid skin improvements eating to satiety? My skin has taken a while to heal. Despite how smooth it has become is still plenty reddened and scarred. My face is riddled with penty of blemishes and I've been eating mostly beef the entire year and strict carnivore for the past 5 months. However, up until recently I had been restricting calories and forcing myself to fast in an attempt to lose weight. None of that had worked and now I'm eating whenever I'm hungry to satiety. And I can eat a lot now, I had 4 pounds of chuck roasts for breakfast this morning and I'm still hungry. Many people transitioning to carnivore for the first time find themselves ravenous as their body attempts to compensate for malnutrition caused by their previous diet. It seems to me like I'm in a similar situation 5 months after starting this woe. Because I'm finally listening to my body and allowing myself to eat as much as I need, couldn't this speed up my skin's ability to heal itself? Perhaps the reason my skin has made less progress than I had anticipated was because of all the caloric restriction? Or maybe it doesn't matter and I just had unrealistic expectations on how long it'd take for my skin to heal fully."

zerocarb,"Bodyfat achievement &amp; maintenance For all members who come from calorie restricting backgrounds, it’s been mentioned many times on ZC Sub that when on carnivore  for a long enough period, your body will heal all the the harm we’ve caused our bodies by starving our selves in effort to look lean and defined. It’s also been stated a lot that your body will initially gain some fat while the healing occurs and then eventually lose the weight and drop down to your body’s favorable weight set point. 

I’m curious however, has anyone who always bounced around the 18-20%bf (you know the kinda not bad not great physique we see a lot), then found themselves dropping and maintaining a significantly lower bf % due to this WOE? 

I see posts all the time of people losing 60lbs and more but I’m guessing these individuals were quite overweight prior to starting ZC and ate very poorly therefore cutting sugar alone would get them to a more healthy bf level but no super lean. 

I’m more curious about individuals who have done bodybuilding diets and weight loss diets in the past and got very lean ‘shredded even’ however realized this is impossible to maintain and gained all the weight back as usual. Let me know your experience on ZC has it been much better? Have u leaned out a lot? Did you maintain it? Did you have to track calories and exercise a lot? Etc

zerocarb,"Lactate in a zerocarb diet Dear community, I have a question:

Human body produces lactate from glucose during exercise (with pyruvate as an intermediary).

Even people who ingest no carbs will have sufficient glucose, via GNG, and some of it will be stored in the muscles. So even those of us who are truly zerocarb will produce lactate from glucose during exercise. 

But my question is: as we get fat-adapted and use ketone bodies for energy, will our production of lactate decrease compared to when we used to eat ""normal"" amounts of carbs? Or put in other words, do people who use ketone bodies for energy (due to a strict zerocarb diet) produce less lactic acid compared to people on the SAD (or just western diet)?


I am not sure if my question is clear enough. If not, I will try to clarify in the comments."
zerocarb,"Question about Carb Cravings Hello, I am half-way through week 5 and I am experiencing increasingly intense cravings -- there were moments where I felt I was going to lose control and just shove anything and everything into my mouth. The cravings are for things like cake, cookies (which are things I don't even have at home). There was one day where I almost felt an uncontrollable urge to go out and buy cookies and eat them. 

I don't know where they come from because I've been eating a clean paleo diet for the past 5-6 years and have basically quit all processed carbs; and prior to carnivore, I was on keto (clean) for about 1-2 months.

So, I'm wondering why I'm suddenly having these never-before-experienced intense lose-all-control kind of cravings? Any theories / explanations / similar experiences to share?

Some background (if useful): I'm F 5ft6"" 135lbs, was eating only beef+organs, salt, water for first 4 weeks; added coffee, egg yolks, lamb, fish in 5th week.

Edit: I was very mindful of eating enough fat, and was definitely close to 75-80% calories from fat. I was also not limiting my food intake and eating a whole lot more than I normally would. I think I’m eating 2lbs or more of food daily."

I’m relatively strict, don’t usually even use seasoning besides salt, but i have drank coffee on and off throughout. I quit totally for almost three weeks but have since backslid to a cup a day most days. I might cut that back out again. 

Anyhow, that’s some background, on to the point. I started the diet with the hopes that my terrible shoulder aches and nerve frailty would alleviate. It definitely seems like I’ve made some progress here, but there’s a lot to be desired. I’ve experienced a lot of other disrelated Improvements but not a whole lot in my specific goal area. From the little I’ve found with people having similar symptoms to mine, it seems i shouldn’t really expect to get out of the woods for as much as 6-9 months so my progress isn’t really alarming or anything, I’m just looking for a little reassurance, see if i can coax out any anecdotes from those coming from a similar place to mine. 

I’m mostly just trying to hear your success stories, not necessarily looking for advice, unless you want to tell me i should quit coffee and why. Thanks for reading.

zerocarb,"Gain muscle and lose fat simply eating to satiety and lifting weights? 5'9 Male 180 pounds 26% bodyfat 

The reason I tried carnivore in the first place was because I thought it was a quick and easy way for me to lose weight. 5 months later I've experienced amazing benefits, become better fat adapted, more energy, ezcema went away and so did asthma, skin improved a lot, my depression had also gone away. 

However 5 months later I find myself with almost the exact same weight, it is a little higher. I tried to lose weight by pairing zerocarb with forced prolonged fasting lasting days and caloric restriction.

After all my attempts to restrict my food in order to get lean had failed, I'm wondering if there is a better way. If I were to simply nourish my body, eat until satieted, eat whenever I'm truly hungry and focused on lifting weights, building muscle, instead of holding back from eating, would I find increased muscle gain and fat loss? 

Is losing weight really about calories in and calories out? Could the hormonal aspect of it play a more significant role? If I just gave my body what it needed and I learned to trust it, would that leave my body to finally shed the excess weight on my body?"

zerocarb,"AntiNutrients in Dairy/Eggs I've found solace in Carnivore or carnivore-ish for the last year+ and only finally, recently discovered that all my health issues were a result of gut issues. Leaky gut, H.Pylori, inflammation in there, etc. 

I've had an intolerance to dairy for awhile now but far more reactive to raw cow/goat milk (only ever tried 100% grassfed), cheeses, kefir (homemade from that goat milk), and yogurts. I'm seemingly more tolerant to butter and eggs though I have had some reactions but when my gut was in a worse state.

So that leads me to my question.. Since I know it's gut issues and my main focus and remedying that, I'm keen on avoiding antinutrients. Dairy and eggs tend to show up along with all the plant foods in a lot of antinutrient categories. I'm more inclined to believe that my poor reaction to the milk and cheese products is due to injured gut lining failing to produce lactase which would explain my minimal reaction to eggs.. Which has me wondering whether eggs and dairy only show up on these antinutrient lists because the animals are consuming grains. Will a free range pasture raised eggs sourced locally equate to less lectins/phytate? 

It'd be easy to say ""I know longer react poorly to eggs to eat away"" but I'm trying to be responsible by giving my gut the best conditions for healing. So if the lectins are there regardless of the chicken feed/living conditions, I'll probably avoid awhile longer.

Finding it very hard to maintain a balance of electrolytes. The past week was fine, but since yesterday evening been feeling a bit nauseous and weak. Today woke up and the feeling continues, now mainly feeling weak and a little bit of palpitations.

Started supplementing with magnesium before going to bed,  and electrolyte drops and salted water throughout the day.

A few questions:

1. Should I surpass the recommended dose of the electrolyte drops? It contains about 100-500mg of potassium, sodium, magnesium (and some others like boron and sulfate). It makes me a bit nauseous if it's not diluted enough.

2. Satiation is not consistent. Sometimes it's just half a salmon fillet, and other times it's 100 grams of beef liver with 400 grams of rib-eye and some eggs. Could this be nausea from electrolyte imbalance affecting me?

3. Today I gradually salted the water and drank small amounts of it (to avoid urinating). How long does it take for the balance to restore? A few hours? A day?"

The after the first week my glucose levels came down substantially and hovered in the 80-85 mg/dl range all day, even after meals.

Also, I'm not calorie restricting but I haven't been particularly hungry due to the vaccinations so maybe it's from not eating enough?

zerocarb,"Worrisome lack of hunger Looking for a little coaching or reinforcement...  


About a month ago, I was thinking about how my health is sort of lousy at 48 and how I don't want to end up in a wheelchair with oxygen and my wife pushing me.  I'm 5'10 and around 212 at the time.  I was tired all the time, weak, ongoing heartburn and joint pain at times.

I started with a lazy sort of low carb, quickly switched to a stricter lowcarb with some results (except heartburn) and finally to zerocarb.   I figure I can try zerocarb and see how my health changes (and hopefully improves) and then consider what (if any) foods are worth adding back.

I'd been lowcarb for a while when I switched, so i skipped the low carb flu thankfully.   Having been on ZC for about a week, I've experienced fast weight loss-  usually a pound a day.  

I'm eating when I'm hungry and eating until I'm full-  just meats and fats at this point.   I was unintentionally doing an intermittent fast for 16 hours a day.

What I'm finding is that I'm just not that hungry and I suspect my calories may be too low.  Yesterday, for example, I'm not sure I hit 1000 calories.   I just wasn't that hungry.  Lost weight.

In the early 2000's, I think I lost a good bit of muscle mass dieting and I don't want to lose more this time because I'm weak enough as it is.

Should I be concerned that I'm not really that hungry?  Should I set a minimum level of calories and make extra effort to get to it?  Will this issue likely pass?

zerocarb,"Zerocarb and longevity Working in the fitness industry, I have witnessed a massive amount of animosity towards 'Fad diets' with carnivore being one of them. The main argument being that these 'diets' aren't sustainable; that any benefits gained are short lived and weight will be put back on almost instantly upon returning to a SAD. This is almost always used as a criticism for the 'Fad diet' itself and not the standard way of eating in our society. It is overlooked that the fact that the weight gain upon returning to a SAD is a result of the flaws in this way of eating.

When I was studying to become a personal trainer we had to learn some basic nutrition. This information was limited to the Australian Healthy Eating Guidelines - the holy food pyramid. Any other approach to nutrition is beyond our scope of practice as a personal trainer. This is extremely frustrating for me as I am constantly inundated with requests for diet plans etc and am not allowed to help other than to recommend a 'balanced diet' based on the food pyramid, or via referral to a dietician or GP.

I believe this animosity is bred as a result of looking at the carnivore way of eating in the lens of a 'diet' - a strict protocol used in a short amount of time with the sole purpose of losing weight. I think this is the wrong way to look at it. This WOE is a simple, effective alternative to a SAD (CICO implementation, constantly stressing about how much you have eaten or if it fits your macros). It is a way of life, you need to be in it for the long haul; especially for those of us who have turned to carnivore for auto-immune reasons. Weight loss / body recomp should be considered a side benefit in my opinion, even if you don't believe you have any underlying gastrointestinal issues as a result of the SAD. I honestly believe that for those of us who have stuck to this WOE, the quality of life increase is enough to stop us from ever going back to a SAD and until we get some solid scientific data, this is enough for me :).

TLDR - Zerocarb isn't some magical weight loss regimen, it's a way of life that can have its ups and downs but if adhered to correctly the improvements to quality of life are so immense that the alternative isn't even considerable."

zerocarb,"Much less garbage and waste since going carnivore. Does anyone here find they have way less trash and recycling to put out since going carnivore? When it comes to buying just meat, all I have are those little styrofoam trays that they sit on for garbage. And because meat is so expensive I don’t let any of it go to waste so I never throw any in the garbage.

I just cleaned my fridge out today and my partner is not carnivore so there were a lot of his things in there that were no more good. Shriveled grapes in the crisper, dried out parsley, limp romaine lettuce. There were also a bunch of wrapped up leftovers that he intended to eat but never did. And I threw out about 5 condiment containers that were expired. Not to mention all the plastic and cardboard packaging that comes with all the snacking he does. I’m so glad when I go grocery shopping now I can just go straight to the meat section, no messing around with all these extra things.

It seems there is way more packaging and waste with the standard way of eating. I’d be curious to know just how environmentally friendly the carnivore diet is. I know my weekly trash has been more than halved. Also I’d think it’s easier on the pocketbook too since we’re not throwing away tons of leftovers."

zerocarb,"What to do with beef bones? This is probably a stupid question to everyone here, but here it goes. I got some pieces of beef bone femur and I don't get how to prepare them. I tried putting them in the oven for 20 minutes and I expected to get a really nice brownish/warm coloured marrowey gel that I could scoop out, but instead the inside of the bones just turned to liquid and spewed out on to the plate which made it difficult to eat (just scooping up oil with a spoon). Then I threw some in with a plain beef stew which was kind of nice but i wasn't prepared for the stew to have such a gel like texture.

 I guess I would like to make some sort of broth with these. Bone broth is not much of thing in Europe, so I don't know how it should be. The recipes I've seen online say to get rid of the contents of the bone and make the broth by simmering just the hard part of the bone, but then I would get losing all the goodness of the marrow. Does anyone know if that is correct? If I were to just boil up the bones as they are (inside included) then I assume the broth would have this gel like texture - is that how bone broth is supposed to be like? I'm totally lost with these bones but I know there's a world of nutritional goodness in there for me! Any tips here would be greatly appreciated!"

zerocarb,"90 Day Update 21M Started this diet back in June because for the past several years I’ve been constantly combatting fatigue, OCD, anxiety, mood swings, depression, the works. Out of sheer desperation I gave this diet a try and I’m sure glad I did.

Started out with ground beef, eggs, and pork, and ribeye.  Eventually found out that the first three foods I mentioned were giving me issues whether it was due to the histamine or plain intolerance. I only eat ribeye now and I feel great. (Rip my bank account)

Energy levels are certainly more consistent, OCD is pretty much gone, depression and anxiety are greatly reduced but still linger and I’m using techniques like meditation and CBT to help mitigate the symptoms.  Been sleeping much better and deeper (waking feeling more refreshed) and having more memorable dreams. Also waking with morning wood more often which was a big issue before. I would go for days/weeks without MW.

Some of the issues such as sleep and energy could’ve been due to the fact that the past year I was living at high altitude ~8000 feet in Colorado. It’s known to negatively affect sleep in some individuals so maybe I had chronic sleep deprivation who knows. Now living at sea level and all in all I feel like a new man. 

I highly recommend this diet to anyone struggling with the aforementioned issues. AND STICK WITH IT.

zerocarb,"After one year, still gain weight and huge appetite After a year of a strict zero carb diet, my appetite is still huge (more than 1.2 kg of meat and 200 g of fat) and I continue to gain weight (80 kg for 1m78).  I know this WOE is not just for weight loss but primarily for healing but I used to be lean before and I think after a year my body must have healed.  I specify that I gained muscle but also a lot of fat.

zerocarb,"I cant eat beef anymore so i've been doing good, eating beef, eggs, liver but i'm getting fed up.

I ate a rib eye the other day and the big chunk of fat that I bit into was a little under cooked... it tasted disgusting. I almost threw up. Ive been loving beef fat but suddenly after that bite I cant eat it anymore. The steak I cooked the next day I couldnt eat either. the taste of beef fat was activating my gag reflex. Since then ive been eating bunless burgers with lean beef mince which is bearable however i cooked some in beef tallow and this also reminded me of that beef fat taste. What the hell do I eat if its not beef??

I loved rib eyes and beef but suddenly I hate it. has anyone else come across this issue?"

zerocarb,"Difficulty reaching maintenance calories Hi guys, I'm quite new to carnivore, about 1,5 weeks in, but have been doing keto (before a three month carb load) for about 6 months. I feel amazing on this WEO and have never had this much energy, mental clarity and I even smile more than I ever have.

The only thing I'm concerned about is maintaing calories. I'm 1.93 meters (+-6""4), 20yo male, 94 kilo's last time I weighed, very muscular but probably a fat percentage in the low 20's. I'm not doing this to lose weight but it's ofcourse welcome.

I eat an estimated amount of about 2000-2300 calories in one sitting (which is already lower than my estimated maintanance, in fact, I used 2000 calories to cut down on weight when I was eating carbs). I feel like I'm forcing myself to eat this much but my body doesn't really like it, not health wise but stomach wise. I eat once a day because otherwise I wouldn't eat, but I don't know for sure if thats a healthy. 

I would eat twice a day, but then I would be forcing that, which I prefer not to. So I'm wondering, does my body know it has quite a lot of excess energy stored as fat? Or should I force myself to just get used to eating twice a day? Adding calories by adding cheese or cream/yoghurt has been recommended but I don't think my body wants that. 

I'd appreciate any advice, either on adding calories or it being okay to listen to my body.

Cheers"

zerocarb,Has anyone tried MeatRx Curious if anyone here has a subscription to MeatRx and if it's worth it. I'm having some struggles after about a year and a half doing zerocarb and every doctor I've seen tries to put me on a statin or get me to eat less meat and more veggies.
zerocarb,"Huge Shout-out. I'm in Love. I'm not a very experienced cook in terms of a lot of different meats, and the tools at my disposal are limited.  So, when I decide to try cooking a different kind of meat that I've never cooked for myself before (or that I did cook before, but it turned out poorly), I try searching this subreddit for instructions (especially because a normal online search always yields results that involve adding spices and rubs and sugars and juices and stuff like that, whereas I like to stick with salt as my *only* seasoning for the meat).

Such was the case with chuck roast.  I tried cooking it myself once before and it turned out pretty bad, which caused me to not bother trying it again and just sticking with ground beef and pork products (read:  pork shoulder, pork belly, pork loin) which I find hard to mess up.  However, despite ground beef being something I was eating (and enjoying) nearly every day for the past several months, I suddenly found myself more recently finding it incredibly unappetizing, almost sick-inducing even (73/27 ground beef, fattiest I can find at Aldi).  So I tried searching this subreddit about chuck roast since I knew that was the cheapest beef that is not ground that is available at my nearest Aldi.  I came across an interesting technique shared by /u/fredmull1973 in the comments of [this post from over two years ago](https://old.reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/830510/quick_question_how_do_you_guys_prepare_a_chuck/dve8r4d/).  It was exactly the kind of technique I needed:  Simple, straightforward, no wild variables that would be easy for me to mess up.  Just multiply the number of pounds by 7 minutes, blast the chuck roast at 500 for that number of minutes, then turn off the oven but keep it closed and let it sit there for 2.5 hours.  It was simple enough that I decided to buy a chuck roast when it was on sale and give it another shot.

I thought, ""if this works, chuck roast may be back on the menu for me.""  Well, not only is chuck roast *definitely* back on the menu for me, but I'm in love.  It turned out absolutely delicious and I was blown away.  Best part is, there's very little cleanup required.  I slapped the chuck roast on a pan lined with tinfoil (okay, honestly it's a rectangular cake-pan lid that hasn't seen the topside of a cake in years), seasoned all sides with salt, followed the instructions, and boom:  Most satisfying meal I've had since Brazilian BBQ.  So, huge shout-out to /u/fredmull1973 for sharing that technique, this will be my go-to method from now on."

I am now taking electrolytes with lemon water, increased my fat and salt intake, and while it improved my situation, it's still nowhere what it used to be last week. So, to put it simply, I'm a bit freaked out. Is this expected and if so, for how long? I kinda need my energy to work and all."

zerocarb,"Only 4 weeks in and this experience has been eye opening and life changing. I had done keto many times before and had hit or miss success with it. Around five years ago, I was at my lowest weight and was feeling really good. Then I got married... they say usually gain weight that first year, and boy did I put on weight... almost 100 lbs (over the course of the past five years). Once you gain some, there is kind of a spiral where you feel terrible that you've gained weight, and then you start eating more to fight back that depression... what didn't help is that I was in a ""work hard, play hard"" type of job that encouraged drinking, hell, there was alcohol flowing at the office. I think at some point that turned into an emotional addiction more than anything, even after leaving that job, I kept up the drinking. I could go maybe a week, at most, without a drink before I would break down and start drinking again. I like to think I was able to hide it, but I don't think that was always true, but I was very functional even after drinking. When I did stop here and there, I never had any physical withdrawls, but the craving was still there and just got stronger and stronger. I knew at some point I needed to stop before it did become a physical addiction, but it was so hard to stop. I even had prescriptions that are supposed to stop the cravings and they didn't help either. 

I had heard of zero carb and carnivore years ago, and I thought it was crazy! Like, how could that be healthy? So I kind of dismissed it, but when I did keto, in the back of my mind I was always saying to myself ""this is annoying, this would be a lot easier if I just ate the meat and didn't deal with everything else"" - because zero carb, meal prep is so easy, unlike keto... and I was always hungry on keto, and always craved carbs.

Then I started hearing people talking about how amazing zero carb had been for them. So I said screw it, I'm gonna do it. My wife thought I was crazy, but she was totally supportive of my decision. So, four weeks in... how are things going? 

* I've lost 30 lbs
* My bad knees feel much better
* I sleep better
* I wake up feeling rested
* I have more energy
* I don't always feel hungry like I did before
* My hair is softer
* My skin is definitely improved
* My daily headaches are gone
* My taste buds are more sensitive, in a good way

Here's the kicker, I stopped drinking the day I started zero carb and that first week, I really did want some beer, but after that, I literally have almost zero interest in it. Now granted, some of those above improvements are probably attributed to drinking less, but I feel so much better. What's more is that I literally have no cravings. I mean, sure, I would love some bread, pasta, or ramen (or really any Asian noodle dish, especially beef noodle soup), but I'm not craving it, and I've been presented with plenty of opportunities to cheat, but I just had no interest in doing it. Normally I would have tried to rationalize why I should cheat (""it's just one meal""), but I haven't done any of that. One day, I ate some wings that had a dry rub on it and I didn't think to ask if they had sugar in them... one bite and I thought it was sickingly sweet (the only sugar I've had this whole time). My wife, which hadn't been doing carnivore at the time, didn't think there was any sugar in it after she had tried it... it really shows how this diet ""resets"" yours taste buds. 

I also think the feeling of ""hunger"" is much different now. I didn't eat breakfast this morning, because I just didn't feel like eating. It's getting close to lunch, and while I can tell my stomach is nearly empty, I'm not really hungry. It's hard to describe. It's almost like, my stomach is empty, but my body doesn't need food or any nutrition right now, so my brain isn't telling me that I'm hungry. 

My wife seeing the improvements has decided to try it and she loves it. She has suffered with migraines for 30 years, with nothing helping... until zero carb. She hasn't had a migraine since she started. She always counted calories, worked out daily, got her macros where they needed to be, and could not lose weight (she does have PCOS which is a bitch to lose weight on), and she's started to lose weight on carnivore. She also loves what it's done for her hair too. 

This is the first diet I'm actually excited about and the first diet I don't dread doing. I have to thank this subreddit for providing so much insight and resources when I was first looking into this and the primary reason I decided to try it. So, thank you to everyone here. 

With that being said, still got the runs, but I know that can be normal in the first month or two, but it's so little, I'm not really concerned about it lol"

zerocarb,"Seeking Carnivore Words of Wisdom Hi guys long time reader first time poster, just after some words of wisdom regarding my current experience.

So to fill in my back story, I am 23 male from Australia, was heavily involved in bodybuilding/gym 5-6 days a week and always followed a regimented diet. I have been unable to get to the gym due to covid 19 lockdown since roughly March and I have not been doing home workouts as I don’t have equipment and honestly don’t have the motivation to do bodyweight or banded work etc.

Given the fact I’m working from home and unable to leave the house much at all, over eating and poor eating had started to creep up for me and I was suddenly not only losing muscle mass from no gym but also slowly gaining body fat too.

I have been following zero carb carnivore forums for a long time and figured what a better time to try it for myself and use it as a tool to wind back my eating and also get the fat loss benefits everyone talks about.

So currently I am 35 days into carnivore, I’ve been eating only red meat, pork, animal fat (the one that comes clarified like a stick of butter, chicken thighs, salmon, eggs, bacon, chicken liver and some sausages / chorizo

I don’t eat dairy as it completely wrecks my stomach and makes me bloated and the only exceptions to the diet I’ve made is a little olive oil and some mushrooms on a few days out of the 35 that’s it.

My WOE has changed and I love it, I now eat a big fatty meaty meal when I wake up and at dinner and that’s it. I’d say roughly 3500 calories per day (used to eat 24-2500 per day before carnivore, but I never ate until I was full I had to track all my food to stay in shape). My digestion has definitely improved I used to get a lot of gas and bloating and farts when I ate vegetables which are now mostly gone. However my stomach does make noises throughout the day which it didn’t use to. My poop has normalled out, it’s a normal consistency once a day just very small ammount.

My main concern however is the fact that I can see myself gaining weight (fat) around my mid section. I’m noticing love handles, ass and abs area getting pretty pudgey. I don’t follow the scale cause after doing bodybuilding I know how much that can mess with ur head but I have gained 2kg and probably lost a fair bit of muscle from not going to gym so possibly even more fat gain than 2kg.

I have heard about the ‘healing initial phase’ and then the weight normally falls off quick and you lean out after 3-4 months ish.

Can someone confirm if this is actually true? Does this happen often? Could anyone share their experience if they’ve gone through this? We are coming up to Australia summer in a few months and although I love this way of eating I don’t really want to keep gaining weight and get to summer looking like I’ve never been in a gym.

Any advice to combat this or any experiences are appreciated!

Thanks"

&gt;**Support us as we move the carnivore diet beyond anecdote to hard clinical data.**  We are embarking upon the first large scale modern clinical intervention trial on this remarkable dietary and lifestyle strategy.  Your valuable support will ultimately affect millions of lives and dramatically alter our understanding of nutrition and how we manage chronic disease.  This is a much needed step in further bringing this powerful intervention to the masses and the impact will be tremendous!  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The size and scope of the clinical trial will be dictated in large part by our budget and thus the following tiered goals are being projected.  We anticipate a 6 month long study with either a single arm vs historical controls or a randomized control group pending funding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$200K- We can do a smaller sized study with limited number of participants and limited outcome measurements  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$500K-This level of funding allows for a far greater number of participants and a greater number of outcomes that we can assess.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;$1 Million- This level of funding allows us to do a very high level Randomized Control Trial of good size with robust outcome measures.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Obviously, we’d like to do the highest quality and most impactful study that we can.  Many of you have seen dramatic changes in your on health using this method and we are asking for your help in legitimizing and bringing it to the masses.

I remember once tried eggs I felt just a little sleepy and thought: well that’s fine I guess, and kept eating them. Dairy (high fat cheese, cream etc) made me feel just a little angry, and also didn’t feel like a big deal and wasn’t significantly changing my state.

zerocarb,"Downsides to cheese being main fat source long-term? (high quality, unpasteurised) Hey hey, so in the last couple of months, cheese has been my main fat source and source of calories e.g. 30-60% of daily calories, depending on the day. Specifically high quality unpasteurised hard cheeses with trace carbs like gruyere, comte, cheddar, etc, in case that makes a difference to your answer.

I'm wondering if there are any possible downsides from a nutritional standpoint to cheese as your main fat source? I'm talking longer-term, not just for a week. It's been 2 months like this and I friggen love cheese.

For example, cheese lacks iron and omega 3, which I cover with the rest of my diet: mostly lamb and seafood for protein, as well as small amounts of ox liver almost daily.

Just to reiterate I'm mainly looking for answers from an optimal nutrition aspect, not the 'cheese causes overeating/weight gain' talk (I'm familiar with and have experienced that already lol!).

Since the pandemic, money has been tight and I have subsequently changed the way I do carnivore. When things were ""normal"" I did well on ground beef for lunch, with a rib eye for dinner. This was my daily go to.

Since the last few months, I have been eating mainly ground beef/lamb/bison. Its more cost effective, and also the steaks I was buying before are often spoiled when you buy them now. I stopped buying and eating them.

This is the only notable change that comes to mind, but the past few months I have absolutely NO energy. Depression symptoms have come back, I have like no libido, and Im dropping weight. (Previously 125, now around 119. So not a lot, but for me it seems a big difference) I feel terrible all of the time.

Most of my joints are feeling better now. The pain is not totally gone but it’s a little better. Throughout the week, i noticed the adaptation process of the diet. Sometimes i felt my mood was upscaling to the more fed up/irritaded level. I felt a little insomnia too. and i began to feel some pain on the back. Where my kidneys are.
I don’t have a gallbladder. So maybe it could be on the liver. I don’t know for sure.

For the good side, i feel i’m loosing some weight. Most of the irritation and insomnia are gone and i feel good generally.

I stopped with outback and began eating mostly supermarket (premium) beef and salmon. Sometimes i have some eggs. And i drink more than 2L of water everyday.

Today i will stop taking Allopurinol. Maybe it would trigger something on my condition. Since i discover is not Gout related. And my doctor told me to do so.

Oh and for exciting news; I got my diagnosis today. My doctor said i had spondyloarthritis. Which totally makes sense. I mentioned that my father was HLA-B27 positive on the comments and has ankylosing spondylitis. I’m really grateful i finally reached this acknowledgement. So thanks to the wonderful doctor and this community!

For the experiment concerns, i still feel positive about the diet. A little scared for i done some research with the bloodwork of some mostly-beef dieters and they looked a little crazy to me. But i decided i’ll give a month for this. If things are ok, i’ll continue for some more. If not, i’ll go keto again.

But anyways, Thank you every one for the words of encouragement and wisdom. I’ll keep doing my experiments and updating 😊.

 [https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Can\_a\_carnivore\_diet\_provide\_all\_essential.99256.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/co-endocrinology/Abstract/9000/Can_a_carnivore_diet_provide_all_essential.99256.aspx)

The aim of this study was to summarize current contributions affecting knowledge and predictions about the nutritional adequacy of plant-free diets, contextualized by historical accounts.

*Recent findings*

As demonstrated in recent experiments, nutrient interactions  and metabolic effects of ketogenic diets can impact nutritional needs,  sometimes resulting in nutrient-sparing effects. Other studies highlight  conflicting hypotheses about the expected effect on metabolic acidosis, and therefore mineral status, of adding alkaline mineral-rich vegetables.

*Summary*

A carnivore diet is a newly popular, but as yet sparsely studied form of ketogenic diet  in which plant foods are eliminated such that all, or almost all,  nutrition derives from animal sourced foods. Ketogenic diets are already  nutritionally controversial due to their near-complete absence of  carbohydrate and high dietary fat content, but most ketogenic diet  advocates emphasize the inclusion of plant foods. In this review, we  discuss the implications of relying solely on animal sourced foods in  terms of essential nutrient status."

zerocarb,"Alcoholism, ZC / Carnivore and lifting, what’s your experience? Getting straight to the point, I’m definitely an alcoholic and that’s not going to change, sure it would be nice to but realistically I’m not ready yet.

I tend to do a even more strict version of the carnivore diet (literally nothing but meat, no cream, no hard cheeses, etc) once every 3-4 months as a way to mass lose fat between my working out (for those that don’t know, you have to eat a stupidly high excess of food, especially ‘good’ carbs to gain muscle at a rapid rate). 

As of a few days ago this is my 4th time going for a month of ZC. The first three times I’ve gone with my extreme version of carnivore however this time, just a few days in my mind has decided to say fuck it and we’re going to add in alcohol spirits aswell.

I really don’t know what to expect adding bland spirits in (alcohol without mixer or at least water/soda water), I’m sure there has to be at least a handful of people in here that know.

Do you still lose weight or does the alcohol break the ‘keto’ side of things and destroy progress?

Does it ruin the focused mindset (obviously the day or two after as the state of drinking / being drunk will always mess up a mindset) but what about after the ‘hangover’?

As for the gym / lifting side, do you still only eat when you’re hungry or do you still have to eat excess?

Can you maintain muscle growth or does ZC / carnivore stop or worse, reduce muscle growth while on the diet?

Really any other related info would be appreciated, I feel this is a fairly untapped area of knowledge within ZC. One can kinda of piece together info through multiple other threads but there’s very limited info on bodybuilding while on ZC, let alone adding alcohol into the mix aswell."

zerocarb,"Halp! Fairly disappointed so far I'm on week 5 of ZC and can't say I've been having particularly great results.

Preface:

I decided to try ZC primarily to lose some body fat as I struggle to be as lean as I would like, to potentially clear up some chronic skin issues, near constant hunger, and to improve sleep and energy. Sleep quality and energy have always been fair (maybe 7 or 8 on a scale to 10), but hey, better is better right and if there was something could do to improve them why not?

 I'll say that my diet starting off wasn't particularly poor, eating a high protein, moderate fat, low carb diet for quite some time (consistently &gt;160g protein, 40-70g fat, &lt;100g carbs). Protein coming primarily from meat (ground beef, turkey, and chicken), greek yogurt, and casein powder. For reference I'm 5'6 155-160lbs.

I'd tried ZC once or twice in the past but only for short periods (about 2 weeks or so), but resolved to give a legitimate 30 days this time.

Current Diet:

As stated, I've just started week 5. A typical day of eating over these past 4 weeks has been about 1-1.5lbs ground beef (primarily 80/20, but starting this week switched to 85/15) + .75-1.0lbs strip or ribeye steak + 3-4 eggs + some hard aged cheddar or goat cheese + 1 cup coffee w/heavy cream. Of course there are days when a meal has been substituted with BBQ ribs and fatty brisket, but that's generally only once or twice a week. I took the first two weeks to wean off artificial sweeteners (primarily stevia) and have been sweetener free for the past 2+ weeks. Consistently drink plenty of water.

Results:

Weight - I lost 2pounds almost immediately, which I'm sure was just water. After the first week or so the weight came back and then started to climb. I'm fairly certain I have put on some fat and do not feel or look as lean as when I started.

Energy - As I said, I didn't consider my energy levels to be a significant issue when I started, but can't really say I've experienced any improvement. If anything, things have gotten worse. I started experiencing consistent daily crashes around 3:00. Feeling completely fatigued and lethargic with little to no motivation to exercise. This is not something that was ever and issue for me before.

Sleep - Sleep quality has been terrible. It was a slow decline and there was a consistent period that was really really bad. I've made a few adjustments and things have gotten better, but still below baseline.

Digestion - I experienced the requisite few days of loose stool, as expected, but that resolved pretty quickly and pooping's been mostly fine which is a pleasant surprise. Definite reduction in gas due to not eating cruciferous vegetables which has been good. More troubling is the consistent mild nausea and acid reflux. Just a general ick feeling in my stomach that seems to last all day, particularly after eating ground beef. It's not lack of hunger, because I still feel hungry and have no problem eating.

Adjustments:

I've tried eating less rendered fat, that definitely causes problems. I started supplementing with 2000mg-4000mg sodium (from real salt) in water with fresh lime juice. I did this daily for a period of weeks, but didn't really notice any discernible affects and have since mostly phased it out. I cut out all dairy (except for heavy cream in coffee). I wasn't eating that much, just a slice or two of aged cheddar or goat cheese on ground beef burgers for flavor. I went about a week and noticed no differences."
zerocarb,"Carnivore: any chance of irreversible side effects? (cross-posted from r/carnivore)

I've been browsing this subreddit and weighing the potential risks/benefits of starting the carnivore diet. I'm (23f) looking to cure my eczema with 6-week carnivore as an elimination diet, starting with 2 weeks just steak/salt/water, then gradually adding back foods after that period. Bf separately is considering carnivore to cure IBS symptoms. It seems like most results are positive but there have been some reports of really bad experiences after transitioning off the diet. For those of you who've seen more on this subreddit:

\- What are the risks we should know about before starting the diet so we can accurately weigh the cost-benefit?

\- How common / irreversible have you heard the following side effects to be for a short-term attempt?

* Gut bacteria fails to adjust after transitioning off the diet
* Worse symptoms after transitioning off the diet
* Permanent hair loss (e.g. due to increased testosterone)
* Anything else?

\- Any way to mitigate risks? E.g. if there's ways to ease into it, even if we won't see full benefits, etc.

However [this](https://thehealthyfoodie.com/grilled-beef-heart/) blogger says you can just grill it for 6 minutes on both sides and then it's ready to be eaten. Is that really going to be easy to eat? I mean you wouldn't grill brisket or leg meat for just 5 minutes, it would be inedible, and according to my butcher the heart should be similarly difficult. Any advice please?? General best beef heart recipes are also welcome! :)

zerocarb,"Season 7 of Alone on the History Channel ended last night. If you're having holdups about eating animal fat or wonder how people live without eating plants - then see how the carnivore diet works in the Arctic on this show. The show is about letting people pick 10 items (axe, bow, matches etc) and seeing if they can survive all alone in a very remote place. 

They used the same area as last season - which was Great Slave Lake in the middle of Canada.

They arrived at the end of summer - so they could pick some berries here and there. Some of them collected them and stored them for later.

One guy finds some mushrooms.

The rest of the show is about FAT! They are all obsessed with fat. Fat from fish like lake trout. Or fat from musk oxes, or porcupines. Unfortunately, they trap rabbits and shoot squirrels and get very little fat out of these small creatures. They're all being careful of rabbit starvation. 

[https://twitter.com/Travis\_Statham/status/1291577299276574720](https://twitter.com/Travis_Statham/status/1291577299276574720) \- Someone catches a fish and is ridiculously happy. Lots of talk about fat. 

Here's a clip I took of Season 6 - which took place in the same area. The winner of that season hunted a moose and was able to outlast the others who couldn't catch enough fish. [https://twitter.com/Travis\_Statham/status/1275627315066798082](https://twitter.com/Travis_Statham/status/1275627315066798082)

Obviously not carnivore - but it does show what facultative carnivore means - you prefer the meat and resort to plants when starving. 

If you want, you could probably get 5-15 minutes worth of clips just by watching the whole season and cutting out clips about fat meat.

You can see what being hungry and only eating meat gets you = a lot of weight loss! Anyways, I think this is a pretty fascinating look at a real-life ""nutrition"" study."
zerocarb,"Looking to get into this diet, newbie questions. Hello,

I have been interested into getting into a zero carb diet for a while now, and I finally gathered the motivation to try it out.

I've been following posts and podcasts but I still got a few questions.

1.Beef/Lamb is somewhat expensive where I live, Chicken and Fish tend to be cheaper. Would it be okay to eat mainly Chicken, Fish, and Eggs 4 days and beef maybe only 3 days/week?
If so, do I need to add butter when cooking them to up the fat content?

2.Butter, I've seen a lot of people swear by grass fed butter, will just regular store bought butter do?

3.I believe some daries are acceptable, could someone help give me some examples of cheeses and or other dairies?

4.What's the general view on canned fish? I tend to eat brine canned fish with 0 carbs/no vegetable oils, is that okay or should I scrap it?

Thanks a lot for any replies."

I noticed weird symptoms when I ate pork belly that I originally attributed to adaptation to the diet, (face flushing, skin tingling and slight digestive upset) so I stopped eating pork. Still was using lard to cook some of my food in though. I couldn't figure out why I would get the same unpleasant symptoms some days and other days not. 

 I hadn't used lard for a while and had a reduction in these symptoms. Recently tried using lard again and I had an immediate reaction. Kind of feel like an idiot for not putting two and two together. So yeah guess I'm intolerant to Pork. Which sucks because pork belly/ lard taste amazing!"

zerocarb,"Body composition worsening; seeking possible reasons I've been Zerocarb/Carnivore since June 2018.  I was in the Air Force back then, so I had a regimented lifestyle: wake up 0300, get coffee, powerlifting for approx. 90mins, ice-cold shower, dress, eat breakfast (12 scrambled eggs cooked in tallow), work an office job (still staying on my feet, though) for 8hrs, go home, eat an early dinner of beef (usually chuck steak), screw around with some PC gaming for an hour or two, have a small glass of whiskey (less than 3oz), go to sleep by 7:30, repeat.  I worked out 5 days a week (3 on, 1 off, 2 on, 1 off), and my body composition was AMAZING.  30y.o., male, 5'9"", staying around 200lbs, 30"" waist, and I was deadlifting over 400lbs reliably.  
  
AUGUST 2019  
I leave the Air Force.  I start with university, but I keep up the powerlifting and throw in some strongman work.  The diet stays exactly the same, my lifting stats behave similarly, and my body composition remains pretty much ideal.  Even with the mandatory classroom sessions in which I'm sitting for two or more hours at a time, everything's still pretty good.  No complaints.  
  
MARCH 2020  
Coronavirus lockdown.  All classes go online.  March 15 is my last day in the gym.  I don't sit for 2+hrs at a time anymore (I love my standing desk!), but I don't have any gym equipment in my house, so I improvise with crates, backpacks, and a lot of circuit training and conditioning workouts.  I make do.  
  
APRIL 2020  
I figure that, with the restricted circumstances, I can cut out alcohol entirely to a particular benefit.  So, I go for it.  No trouble as far as habit or cravings - the desire to drink was utterly nonexistent.  So, no stress from that, and really no impact (for better or worse) on quality of sleep.  But, it's one less drain on my bank account and one less non-carnivore aspect of my diet.  So, I stick with not drinking.  I start cutting costs on meat by buying USDA Prime brisket from Costco at $3.29/lb (holy hell that's a deal!).  I eat somewhere between 15-20lbs a week.   
  
AUGUST 2020   
The gym's open again!  4.5 months of not picking up insanely-heavy things took its tool on my stats.  Despite the conditioning workouts, the lack of stillness, and the removal of alcohol, there's notably more chin and waistline fat that I simply can't accept.  I get back to (almost) my old routine, now doing 2 days on, 1 day off, repeat.  I keep grinding at it, and my lifting numbers will rise over time.  
  
+3 WEEKS  
My body composition is somehow even less favorable now.  I suspect that some balance of protein-to-fat is off.  I've noticed that the prime brisket, even though it's 80-85% fat by appearance (seriously, it's ridiculous), isn't satisfying my appetite.  I've swapped some of it for liver or locally-raised pastured eggs.  My hunger is somewhat more mitigated by that, and I tilt towards more protein in the process.  But, even with 3 weeks of this, my chin and waist fat are hanging on.  Now I'm getting pissed off to a new level.  
  
SO, I have a few considerations, obviously with varying degrees of merit, and I'd like your input on them:  
  
1) Is brisket somehow less-substantial (whether by micronutrients or protein density) than, say, chuck roast?  
  
2) Does alcohol (SPARSELY consumed in MODEST quantities) have some benefit to body composition?  
  
3) Should I just go completely off-grid, forsake all adulterations and contrivances, and just become Amish?  Y'know, build barns, work the harvest, never drink, smoke, or sip coffee, and grow a big-ass chinstrap beard to accentuate my scowl?  
  
At this point, I need something to change, because this lifestyle is definitely not working like I know it should."

zerocarb,"Fatty Cuts of meat UK So Ive recently got into pork belly which was great because before hand I was getting my fat mainly in the form of oil (Tallow, olive oil) which I think doesnt agree with my digestive system while white animal fat seems to go down a treat.

I like pork belly becuase it seems to be as close to the fat:protein 3:1 ratio as I can get in the supermarket; even the fattiest steak doesnt have that much white fat on it.

Yesterday I ate alot of pork belly and this morning I woke up with standard allergic symptoms (Puffy red eyes that I used to get from my previous diet (standard western diet).

After a little research apparently the poor quality grain feed on which these pigs are reared on can affect the quality of the fat...

Could this have caused my symptoms?

Newbie here, only 10 days- still not fat adapted yet.

I’ve been struggling with SEVERE digestive issues for over two years now which has progressively gotten worse and worse and has severely affected my daily life and happiness. 

At this point I feel like I have tried almost everything with absolute no relief : lowFODMAP, gluten free, dairy free, plant based/vegetarian diet, probiotics, supplements, herbal antimicrobials, low carb, intermittent fasting, prokinetics, etc... Also used to chug bunch of kombucha everyday. (yikes! I know!).

Been diagnosed with SIBO in the past, and “functional dyspepsia” -an umbrella term for conventional docs who don’t know wtf is going on haha. 

Anyways, was curious if any of you guys have had success getting rid of or even improving chronic digestive issues! I am desperate for a solution and have read many successful carnivore stories!!! I’m really starting to think that zero carb may be the solution to restoring my microbiome.

Today is my 10th day into ZC and still experiencing chronic digestive problems (reflux, slight bloating, side pains, upper GI discomfort). Been eating mainly beef, pork, eggs, and bacon. Only supplement with salt and water. Ditched caffeine couple months ago. 

Any of you guys find any gastrointestinal relief from this diet?! If so, any tips for a ZC newbie like me? Just curious how long did it take before you started to notice improvement?

At once i thought it was gout so i did a research and started taking allopurinol. Had some success but it came worst when i stopped. So i went to the doctor. She told to return on taking allopurinol (which aparently it hasn’t making any progress) but we’re still investigating.

Recently i came across some youtube videos on the keto/carnivore/zerocarb diets. I done keto in the past but i thought it was a little hard to count macros, carbs and stuff like that so i thought i could have a shot on this carnivore diet.

So since the episode (about one month ago) i was reducing more and more the carbs. To the point i was eating almost keto. Chicken only. Then i made a prolonged water fasting 3 days ago. And finally yesterday, i broke up the fasting with some outback ribs and steak without sauce.

Woke up today with some pain. But as soon as i ate one more steak and ribs for lunch, i got very tired and went for a nap. When woke up i had noticed that my pain magically went away. I’m so happy right now, even teared a little.

Anyways, this must be to soon to say something about the diet or red meat. But something tells me this is the best decision i could come up to. I’ll continue experimenting.

Just wanted to share this with you.

zerocarb,"Anyone else plateau 20 lbs away from goal weight? I have been stuck at 180 lbs for a couple months now. I can tell by body measurements, where I’m carrying fat (stomach, hips, and back), and by my general lack of endurance that I’m not at a healthy weight yet. I’m 23, 5’7” and 3/4, &amp; F and have an autoimmune thyroid disorder. Last October 2019 I was 270 lbs, about 107 pounds over the highest healthy BMI weight for my age, height and gender (163 lbs). I tried this diet as a last resort and it was the first thing I ever tried in my life that has ever worked. I have tried intermittent fasting (breakfast and lunch but no dinner) and I even tried OMAD but that didn’t work long term because I couldn’t eat enough calories in one meal and I felt terrible from calorie restriction. I’m starting ADF tomorrow. Seems like there might be a point in this WOE where you just stop losing weight and have to incorporate exercising, fasting, etc to reach a healthy weight.

I’m upping the amount of exercise I do, in particular cycling and weight training: it’s something I enjoy, and which I let slide a bit in mid twenties. 

I can’t figure out if I am having mental health issues, or whether I’m under-eating. I have a history of anxiety. Both my brain, and body, is working hard at the moment. I feel much better after eating, but between meals am irritable, grumpy and resentful for no good reason. It’s like about two hours after a meal I run out of fuel, and am running on empty. I can feel my adrenals pumping the cortisol. 

I’m sleeping a solid eight hours, getting in some leisure time. I’d estimate I’m getting about 50% more in calorific values in than before, and am doing about an hour’s exercise on average. (Two rest days, usually exercise between an hour and ninety minutes when I do).

I have ME/CFS, fibro, low-symptomatic gastroparesis, severe chronic pain, exercise intolerance, SIBO, and probably mast and histamine issues. I was actually doing alright-ish digestively (well controlled IBS) until a course of amoxicillin gave me SIBO and I just can NOT recover.

I've held out on committing to zerocarb because it seems like a ""you can never go back"" situation, and historically, red meat and pork constipated and disagreed with me. But I'm desperate and it seems worth a shot. I'm already down to 8ish safe foods that aren't even that safe for me anymore. 

I'm a little overwhelmed AND fighting brain fog and exhaustion. Is there a long single post somewhere that details how to get started?

I've seen the flip answer of ""beef salt and water"" but even this seems nuanced as it can't be ground beef due to histamine, don't drink a bunch of water with the fatty beef, gotta play around with fat level, etc.

I've seen alot of recipes online and a few posts about it in here but opinion seems to be divided about which fat works best. Most say to use bacon fat but I'm not the biggest fan of pork, and I honestly don't see how it won't just make everything taste like bacon. I tend to use butter mostly when cooking but I've no idea if it would work or not.

Also any tips about the actual method would be awesome. I do have a food processor which I intend to use but I don't know if certain fats will or will not work if I try to use it.

Yesterday I cooked a brisket, which is very delicious, but I noticed shortly after eating it I felt uncomfortably full and a bit nauseous. I normally eat 400 grams of ground beef per sitting with absolutely no issues. So I did the same with the brisket, weighed out 400 grams and ate it.

It is a fatty brisket, so I’m wondering if my body just isn’t used to the non rendered fat you normally get from ground beef. Also, I’m assuming your stomach has to work a little harder digest the meat since it’s not already ground. Just curious to hear if anyone has similar issues.

zerocarb,"Deer meat quality I wrote this as a comment in another thread, but it was a bit off topic, so I’m posting it as a new thread.

What do you think of deer meat quality?

Wild game is generally seen as pristine high quality meat, roaming free, eating a natural diet and such. But I’m not so sure deer fall in this category, let me explain what I mean:

It depends heavily on the area where the deer live, but around my parts there are lots and lots of corn and wheat fields.
I’ve seen many deer while driving, mostly in these grain fields. And here is my point. Even conventional grain fed beef gets “edible grain feed”, meaning they don’t eat grains that have just today been sprayed with some nasty pesticides, because the pesticides have a prescribed time period during which the sprayed plants shouldn’t be harvested (same with fruit trees and veggies), because the plants have a very high concentration of these chemicals during this time. Now the deer feeding on these fields don’t adhere to these regulations :)). They also drink pesticide laden water which surounds these fields.

So it got me thinking if deer actually is this pristine wild meat, or can it be potentially even lower quality than conventional beef. I’m not sure what percentage of their diet they get from these fields, but if the animal relies heavily on pesticide laden crops, it makes no sense to pay double or triple the price of beef for it. Maybe for a treat, if you like the taste, but health-wise they can potentially be worse than farm animals.

Any thoughts?"
zerocarb,"Brisket is my new favorite cut of meat! Wow I can’t believe it took me this long to try brisket! I’ve been zerocarb now for almost 2 years and mainly eat pork belly and ground beef because they’re usually the less expensive meats. Anyway the other day a friend and I went to eat at a ribs place. I got ribs and he got the brisket that was cooked slowly for 16 hours. He gave me a bite and omg it was delicious. I immediately needed to recreate this at home. I went to Costco and this cut of meat is incredibly cheap. I bought a 14lbs brisket for $50 and brought it home and since I don’t have a smoker I checked on YouTube and you can also smoke meat on a gas grill you just turn on one burner and set it so the temperature is between 225-250 degrees. For wood chips you just make an aluminum pouch and put them on the same side as the lite burner and put the meat on the other side. I cooked mine for 10 hours on the grill until it got a good smoke, and then it was getting late so I wrapped it in foil and put it in the oven at 225 degrees for another 12 hours. 

This morning when I woke up the brisket was perfectly cooked and so juicy. Not only that but it’s a very fatty cut of meat so we’re definitely getting all the fat we need. Also at 14lbs I now have food for the week, no need to cook. 

I guess what probably deters people away from cooking this cut of meat is that it takes a long time but it’s definitely worth the wait. And you pretty much can set it and forget it, no need to watch it all day long. So glad I tried it!"

Edit: I have tried different brands. From the cheapest ones at the grocery store to the ones at a farmer's market. My favorite is Vital Farms' because of how orange the yolks are. My results don't vary much between brands. But I did have a really bad reaction to duck eggs from the farmer's market."

zerocarb,"The 2:1 ratio DISCLAIMER: I am not convincing you must eat this or that ratio. It is purely out of analytical curiosity to measure.

The 2:1 ratio is often misleading. Here's my take on it.

It is known, that 1g fat = 9 kcal and 1g protein = 4 kcal.


1)In The Bear's Words Of Wisdom, which is recommended read in this subreddit, Owlsey Stanley says: ""My diet is usually 60% fat and 40% protein by calories. I used to eat 80/20 when younger and about twice as much quantity of meat also, but that seems too much energy at my age, which is 71- even though I am very active.""


Let's examine 80/20 this time.
We can put it like this:

80 kcal from fat and 20 kcal from protein

Then, we can put in the unknown with multipliers:

 fat x 9g = 80 kcal and  protein x 4g = 20 kcal

80/9=~8.9=~9 g fat and Y=20/4=5 g of protein

In order to have a diet of fat/protein as 80/20 in calories we must eat diet of 9:5 as in fat to protein ratio in grams.

9:5=1.8:1=~2:1



2)On the other hand, Paul Saladino, as well as some reddit posts I read recommends a ratio of fat to protein as 1:1 in grams.

Okay, here we go: 

1 gram fat = 9 kcal and 1 g protein = 4 kcal


This can be put into a ratio of 9:4 as in calories obtained by eating a diet of 1:1 as in fat to protein ratio in grams.

9/4=2.25:1=~2:1


TL;DR

In order to obtain 80/20 fat/protein in calories we must eat ~2:1 fat to protein(1.8:1 to be exact). On the other hand, by eating 1:1 fat to protein we obtain ~2:1 ratio of calories fat to protein. (2.25:1 to be exact)

This proves why 1:1 and 2:1 are often confused."

I felt horrible the first 2-3 days of carnivore and now I'm doing great except I feel sluggish/tired after meals, particularly lunch (my first meal of the day, I just don't enjoy eating in the morning).

The first few days, I figured out I wasn't eating enough fat, and I now try to eat a 1:1 gram ration of fat to protein. This has helped with cravings and overall satiety. But I'm still wanting to reach for an afternoon coffee (weaning down slowly, but I'm still dealing with physical addiction...ugh).

zerocarb,"Actor Liam Hemsworth underwent kidney stone surgery due to a vegan diet * Australian actor Liam Hemsworth told Men's Health that he had to ""completely rethink"" his vegan diet after undergoing surgery for a kidney stone.
* Some foods are high in substances called oxalates, which can increase risk of kidney stones. These include spinach, potatoes, nuts, and even chocolate.

In a recent interview with Men's Health, Australian actor Liam Hemsworth said he'd recently had surgery for a kidney stone, and that it was likely due to the huge amount of vegetables he was eating as part of his vegan diet. 

He had been following a vegan diet for four years until a health scare in February 2019 had him rethink how he ate. Hemsworth explained that he had initially followed a vegan diet for health reasons and he ""felt great"" following it at first, even though things have changed. 

The actor said his morning smoothie included almond milk, plant protein, and five handfuls of spinach.

""And that was what I considered super healthy. So I had to completely rethink what I was putting in my body,"" Hemsworth told Men's Health. ""Once you get one kidney stone, you have a 50% chance of getting another one if you continue eating the way you were eating.""

""In February of last year I was feeling lethargic. Then I got a kidney stone. It was one of the most painful weeks of my life,"" he told Men's Health magazine."" ... I had to go to the hospital and get surgery.""

He explained that although he thought his diet was ""super healthy,"" he ""had to completely rethink"" what he was eating after the kidney stone, which he said was caused by consuming too much oxalate. High amounts of oxalates can be found in popular vegan foods, like beans, spinach, and beetroot.

zerocarb,"Getting added fat As I'm sure any regulars have noticed, I've been commenting a lot lately about air frying steaks (because it's convenient and amazing). Anyways, in an effort to get more fat I've been experimenting with using more butter. I started out just topping my steak with a good heap of it, but the downside to that is the majority of it will just melt and run off. Next, and what I'm doing currently, is keeping a butter dish next to me when i eat and spreading a little with each bite. This is definitely efficient, but it kind of detracts from the taste of the steak that I've come to love. What other ways do you all get added fat?"
zerocarb,"Strategies to keep myself from eating trashy foods Hello you all,

First off thank you all for your super valuable help. I am really happy to see so many people thriving on this diet! Thank you for helping and spreading the word!

My issue is that when I go on a party and I am surrounded by people who are not doing this or any specific diet, there is always a lot of trash food like cakes, chips, and other high carb/high crap snacks involved. Since I am not doing this diet for autoimmune issues, there is no need for me to stick meticulously to the diet. However, I will still not feel too great when I consume those foods (bloating, water retention, bad sleep).

As a result, I end up over indulging in trashy foods despite the fact that it won't make me feel great the next day. I know that it will make me feel bad (not horribly bad but still bad enough), however, it is super hard for me to keep myself from doing it. It's like I am lacking self control in those environments. I know that it's not good, yet I am doing it. At home, on the other hand, I have zero issues following this diet and I feel great. 

Do you guys have any advice on how to tackle this problem? I would love to get rid off all those ""fake cravings"" and feel fantastic the next day without having the feeling of missing out on supposedly nice foods. 

Thank you!"

This is how much meat other carnivores eat per meal:

Male lion: 16 pounds

Female lion: 11 pounds

Shawn Baker: 5 pounds

Wolf: 5 pounds per day, but can eat 22.5 pounds in one sitting

100 pounds shark:  3 pounds of fish

Spotted Hyena (my favorite animal): Can eat up to 32 pounds per meal

Grizzly: Up to 90 pounds

Polar bear: Up to 150 pounds in one sitting

My thoughts: This shows how well humans are adapted to eating meat. Even though we have huge brains, we dont have to eat that much meat compared to other carnivores. Keep in mind that the meat we eat is probably fattier than the prey of a lion or hyena, since in Africa animals are generally very lean."

zerocarb,"Going ZC - need some guidance Hello, this is my first post on Reddit. Ever. I'm a 22 y/o male, 5'11, 155 lbs. Around two years ago I developed an auto-immune disease called Alopecia Areata. First a bald patch appeared in my glorious beard, which spread rapidly and decimated nearly 80% of it, sparing only my mustache and goatee. Then about a year later I discovered two bald patches behind both of my ears, they grew in size and I can barely hide one of them now by keeping my hair long. I was under a lot of stress 2 years ago and my entire diet consisted almost exclusively of rice and kebabs. I worked in a Persian restaurant for 3 years and had just quit when my Alopecia started. Since then I've diversified my diet, incorporating fruits, greens and dairy and I kept eating rice and still rely heavily on it for energy, because I'm a professional athlete now, training 4-5 hours a day. Diversifying my diet didn't help and in fact I was on it when I got the two patches on my head. I suspect that rice is the culprit, however every food is a suspect at this point, except meat. So here's what I'm planning to have my new diet look like: 

1. Beef (fattiest pieces)
2. Lamb 
3. Chicken
4. Turkey
5. Duck (as an occasional treat) 
6. Fish (Salmon/Mahi Mahi mostly)
7. Organ meat
8. Bone broth with turmeric and possibly garlic

My goal is to reduce inflammation and restore my immune system. I'm not sure if it even has anything to do with what I've been eating, but I've heard enough testimonies to give it a try. Can any experienced ZC'ers chime in on this? Is this a decent plan? Do you think I can still train as hard while on this diet? My hair has also been shedding ridiculously for over a year, but no signs of Male Pattern Baldness, so it might be related to my Alopecia. Any advice/opinions are welcome (and much needed)"

Mighty meat: Would you eat beef that's been aged for months and encased in suet?

[link to article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/mighty-meat-would-you-eat-beef-that-s-been-aged-for-months-and-encased-in-suet-1.2880991%3Fmode%3Damp)

The article mainly talks about older beef and how delicious it is and the many ways to preserve it. 

It describes the process here:

“Kelly first heard about the process while attending a food fair in Germany and has spent the past year perfecting it in Irish conditions. The meat first spends 28 days hanging in a fridge. “That’s not dry ageing, for that you need temperature and humidity control, and our old butcher shops don’t have that,” Kelly says.

It’s what happens next that is unusual. Kelly submerges the meat in rendered kidney fat, at a specific temperature, and this process allows a crust to form on the steak so no moisture or air can enter. The meat is encased in the suet which hardens as it cools, and it remains there for a further 28 days.

“The steak emerges as a vastly improved product. It is tender and succulent, literally melting in the mouth, and has developed remarkably complex depths of flavour,” according to Kelly, who suggests frying the steak in some of the suet and using more to roast the potatoes to accompany the meat.”


———————

I am looking forward to doing this in the future once I open the farm in Spain or I might start now with butcher bought meat and tell you guys how it tastes. 

Once it is encased in the suet it doesn’t say whether we should keep it in the fridge or outside, where do you recommend keeping it?

Answer: I’ve now read that they keep it chilled. 



Has any of you tried this method before?

Looking forward to your answers!"

""The cooks at Lacedemon might not dress anything but flesh. He who was skilled in any other kind of cookery was cast out of Sparta. Son of Polybiades, for being grown too fat and heavy through luxury and idleness, they took out of the public Assembly, and threatened to punish him by banishment, unless he altered that blamable and rather Ionic than Laconic course of life: For his shape and habit of body was a shame to Lacedemon and our Laws"". - [Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=pztoAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=editions%3Ab8dpoXN4Gm4C&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

""The dish that was in the highest esteem among the Spartans was called melas zomos, or ""black broth"" a name which has long excited the curiosity of the learned. What were the precise ingredients of this mess has never been determined with certainty. We remember an old traveler, who, on observing the use of coffee for the first time in the East, conjectured that it was the black broth of the Lacedaemonians! Julius Pollux the preceptor of the Emperor Commodus in his ""Onomasticon"" says that this famous mess consisted of blood thickened in some particular way. Dr. Lister in his ""Notes to Apicius"" supposes it was hog's blood; and if so the dish must have had no remote resemblance to the black puddings of our own times. Whatever it was, it could have formed no very alluring dish. We are informed that a citizen of Sybaris having tasted their fare, declared that it was no longer astonishing to him that the Spartans should be so fearless of death in battle, since any one in his senses would much sooner die a thousand deaths than continue to exist on such miserable food. Plutarch relates that a king of Pontus having heard of this celebrated broth purchased a Lacedaemonian cook to make some of it for him. But when he came to taste it he expressed his detestation of the mess in very strong terms on which the cook observed, ""Sir, to acquire a relish for this broth it is necessary first to bathe in the Eurotas;"" meaning that the hardy habits of the Spartans gave a zest to this fare which it could not otherwise possess. The same writer informs us that the old men were so fond of it that they ranged themselves on one side to eat it leaving the meat to the young people"". - [Source](https://books.google.com/books?id=4OE2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=melas+zomos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHzfmTlfrqAhUPsaQKHVsuBCQQ6AEwAnoECAMQAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

Nowadays, it is believed that melas zomos was made of boiled pigs' legs, blood, salt and vinegar. It is thought that the vinegar was used as an emulsifier to keep the blood from clotting during the cooking process."

zerocarb,"Finally buying a cow - heifer or ox? Currently on the hunt for some grass fed meat here in Germany.

I've found this awesome farmer couple that treat the cows very good and practice regenerative agriculture. The breed they raise is called ""Charolais"" and these monsters eat grass on the pasture for 7 months, and hay during the winter. Absolutely no corn, soy, drugs, etc but they are still huge beasts with great marbling.

They don't dehorn them as it collapses their sinuses apparently and their skulls will grow deformed to compensate. When it comes slaughter time, they drive down the road and sleep for the night. After that, they slaughter them as quickly and humanely as possible. I really think I hit the jackpot here.

For a half share, heifer meat would be $3.27 per pound. That's not a typo. For a whole, it's $2.68. Plus butcher fees (\~$200).

However, they have an 5 year old ox (castrated) that is about 460kg slaughtering weight or 300kg (660lb) of pure meat plus whatever bones, organs, etc that I want. They said if I'm interested, they'll make me a good deal on him. It'll be about \~$2/lb I'm assuming plus about $300 in butcher fees.

The rule of thumb is 1 cu ft per 40lbs of meat. 661lbs would require about 16 cu ft.

I only have 7 cu ft right now, so I'd have to buy 1 or 2 more freezers. ($600). Another option is to do a 'cow share' but that seems like a lot of work. From my understanding, the ox meat will likely be ""tougher"" and less marbled. Anyone have any taste experience with ox meat?"

zerocarb,"Meat Diet. The Gazette of Health by Richard Reece, M.D. (1821) ""I here would observe that I permit the patient to take the meat in any way which he prefers. Of course roast and boiled mutton and beef are principally employed. Patients I believe could scarcely be prevailed upon to live upon meats rancid and putrid. Indeed I never made the trial as I found by experience that even when they were permitted to take the meat in such variety and manner as they pleased not one would entirely refrain from vegetables although convinced that they were hurtful. All the patients who employed a meat diet soon became fatter and stronger and made less water materially and that of a less diabetic quality than before. The amendment appeared the most conspicuously in the worst cases. Miss Y.Z. (3) was so much reduced and the disease appeared to be making such rapid progress that I believe she could not have lived above a month or six weeks longer had the complaint been left to itself. Mr B.I. (5) was still worse and I have no doubt would have died within a fortnight. Yet after this Miss Y.Z. (3) recovered so far that she could continue in bed through the whole night frequently without rising to make water and could walk five or six miles at once without material fatigue and Mr B.l. (5) who had been a remarkably active man in business amended to such a degree that he carried on his business with the same activity as before his illness. Amendment though not to the same extent was equally perceptible in the other patients who employed a meat diet. Yet that it had not effected a cure was evident from this circumstance that whenever they deviated materially from the meat diet the diabetic symptoms were induced"".

**Abstract:**

The virtues of “plant-based” eating are commonly extolled in public and academic discourse, in particular in postindustrial countries and exceedingly so on a global level. Animal source foods, on the other hand, are regularly stigmatized for their alleged link with disease, environmental deterioration, and animal abuse. Although there is a reasonable case for the improvement of animal agriculture, this discourse leads to a binary and counterproductive view of food systems: plants are largely seen as beneficial and animal source foods as intrinsically harmful. We argue that this animal/plant binary and the promotion of civic responsibility to accept it as such are cultural constructs that emerged in the Anglosphere during the 19th century. The divide has been continuously evolving since and is currently deepening due to a global sense of urgency, underpinned by various societal anxieties and normative responses. A symptomatic example is provided by the recent call for a Planetary Health Diet and a Great Food Transformation by the EAT-Lancet Commission and its wider network.

zerocarb,"""The Relation of Alimentation and Disease"" - a carnivore diet book published by James H. Salisbury, M.D. in 1888 I have recently come across yet another vintage carnivore diet book published by James Henry Salisbury, M.D. in 1888. For those unfamiliar with this author, he was a 19th-century American physician, chemist and the inventor of the Salisbury steak. He was also one of the earliest health food faddists and taught that diet was the main determinant of health. He believed vegetables and starchy foods produced poisonous substances in the digestive system which were responsible for heart disease, tumors, mental illness and tuberculosis. He also believed that human dentition demonstrated that humans were meant to eat meat, and sought to limit vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet.

In 1888, Salisbury published a book ""The Relation of Alimentation and Disease"" in which he described his scientific experiments and findings that lead to his conclusion that humans were designed to eat primarily animal products. Below are some of the interesting highlights I have made while reading it:

""Stomach - carnivorous organ, meat-digesting organ"".

""As a general rule, we have twenty meat teeth, and only twelve vegetable teeth; while four of these latter, the ""wisdom teeth,” are poor apologies as grinders. The stomach, in man, is a purely carnivorous organ, and is designed, both in structure and function, for the digestion of lean meats"".

""The simple plans here briefly set forth are the outcome of our natural structure. Nature gives us these plain indications in our make-up. As fully stated elsewhere in these pages, we have twenty meat teeth and only twelve vegetable teeth. The stomach (the first and largest organ of the digestive apparatus) digests nothing but lean meats, while the small bowels, with the secretions of the liver, pancreas and glands of Lieberkuhn and Brunner, digest vegetable foods and fat"".

""By structure, man is about two-thirds carnivorous and one-third herbivorous. In his native, wild state he feeds mainly upon game and fish, with much less than one-third of vegetable products. In this state he is free from most of our fatal diseases, such as Consumption, Bright’s Disease, Diabetes, Locomotor Ataxy, Paralysis, Fatty diseases of vital organs, Tumors, and the various forms of Cancer. He is also exempt from most infectious complaints, such as Smallpox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and so on. These only reach him when he comes in contact with our much lauded civilization - a civilization full of ""shirking responsibility,” of sin and of the causes of disease"".

""The smallness of the passages is due to the meat foods being nearly all utilized in nourishing the body"".

""The experiments upon meat feeding showed that meats, and especially beef and mutton, can be subsisted upon without resulting in diseased states, for a much longer time than can the best vegetable products under the same conditions. The reason of this is that the first organ of the digestive apparatus - the stomach - is a meat-digesting organ. I have had patients afflicted with grave diseases, thrive and become perfectly well upon beef. Many of them have continued this as an exclusive diet from three to four years, before bringing breads and vegetables into their diet list"".

""Good, fresh beef and mutton stand at the head of all aliments as foods promotive of human health. Eggs, fish, pork, veal, chickens, turkeys and game come in merely as side dishes: they may be subsisted upon singly for a limited time without bad results"".

""It is not enough to take solely into account the chemistry of foods. Many foods which are chemically rich are so composed that it is beyond the power of human stomachs and bowels to digest them. The connective tissue of meat, on the one hand, and beans on the other, are products that no human being should undertake to subsist upon if he does, he will expose himself to causes that imperil healthy states"".

""Vegetable Dyspepsia, or the first Stage of Consumption. This arises from the too exclusive and long-continued use of vegetable or amylaceous and saccharine foods and fruits, or either of them. The stomach is the first organ to suffer. In man this organ is mainly designed for digesting lean meats. It may be called a purely carnivorous organ. It requires lean meats to excite normal quantity of healthy secretions in its glandular follicles for digestion, and the healthy excitation of these secretions stimulates the muscular-fibres to maintain those normal downward peristaltic movements which are necessary for physiological digestion and transmission"".

""The stomach does not digest amylaceous and saccharine foods, fruits and fats. These are digested by the secretions that are poured out into the duodenum by the liver, pancreas, and glands of Lieberkuhn and Bruner"".

""Hence the too exclusive and long-continued use of vegetable, and especially amylaceous and saccharine food, fills the stomach with materials which do not stimulate it even enough to pass them along to where they are digested, in consequence of which they lie so long in this organ that fermentative processes supervene little by little, and we have the stomach filled with carbonic acid gas, sugar, alcohol, acid and alcoholic and acid yeast plants. These products of fermentation soon begin to paralyze the follicles and muscular walls of the stomach, so that it becomes flabby and baggy, and will hold an unusual amount of trashy foods and fluids. The organ has been turned into a veritable sour ""yeast pot,” and we have the first stage of the disease known as vegetable dyspepsia of the stomach, or the first stage of consumption. In this stage of the disease, the stomach is almost constantly distended with gas, which is only partially relieved by the frequent sour eructations"".

""As soon as food that cannot be digested is taken, more or less flatulence occurs, which reverses to a greater or lesser extent normal peristaltic action. This works the bile up into the stomach, and back into the gall bladder and gall ducts the patient becomes what is called ""bilious"", the urine is high colored and scanty, and stands at a density of 1.030 and upwards, and deposits a sediment on standing"".

""If the patient, from accident or any other cause, loses the appetite for meat, the urine will be found higher colored, and the stomach dirty and containing bile. This condition may have been caused by poor meat (badly broiled or immature beef and etc.)"".

""Such persons have, as rule, less nervous and muscular endurance than meat-eaters. Officers of the English army in India, for example, assure me that it is always necessary to start the native troops off on march one day in advance of the British soldiers, that all may arrive at given point on the same day"".

""In Rio de Janeiro there is a Spanish physician meat-eater who is now one hundred and ninety-three years of age, and who is yet quite strong and active, mentally and physically.""

""Professor Lesquereux tells me that this Protestant people use more of a meat diet than the poorer class on the opposite side of the river, the food of which people is almost entirely vegetable"".

""This kind of feeding should be persevered in till Nature holds out the sign for the gradual introduction of lean meats into the dietetic list. This moment is indicated by the gradual development of the meat teeth. With the first appearance of the incisors, beef tea and the juice of beef may be introduced, and finally beefsteak and other lean meats may be partaken of with the milk"".

""When the meat or front teeth begin to show themselves, Nature tells us that the time has arrived when a little meat food would be desirable. It should be brought in, in the way of beef juice and beef pulp. This should at first be given simply as a side dish and in small quantity. As more meat teeth appear, more meat may be given, the diet consisting of lean meat and milk only"".

""By following these simple rules all colics, dyspeptic troubles, ""summer complaints"" and the attendant head complications may be avoided, and the consequent great fatalities of childhood escaped"".

""The bean is chiefly made up of double walled sacs of legumen, which are filled with starch grains. These sacs are as insoluble in the digestive fluids as woody fibre, and the only way in which the secretions of the digestive organs can get at the contents of these insoluble sacs, is by the starch grains undergoing fermentation. This liberates large quantities of carbonic acid gas, which gas explodes the sacs. By the time the digestive fluids reach the contents of these exploded sacs, the starch is decomposed into carbonic acid gas, alcohol, vinegar and yeast vegetation, products that are quite unfitted to afford healthy nourishment, but are rather agents to feed pathological states. By examining the stools with the microscope, the day after a diet of beans, the whole mass will be found to be made up of exploded and non-exploded sacs of legumen, and the products of their fermenting contents"".

""Drink from a half pint to a pint of hot water, from one to two hours before each meal and on retiring, for the purpose of washing out the slimy, yeasty and bilious stomach before eating and sleeping. Drink a cup of clear tea, coffee or beef tea (the latter free from fat), towards the close of each meal, sipping slowly. During the interval, between two hours after, and one hour before each meal, drink hot water or beef tea if thirsty"".

""Drink hot water daily, as prescribed in previous chapters. Take also one half pint of beef tea - made from pure lean meat fibre, free from tendons, cartilage and fat at each meal, and the same amount between two hours after breakfast and one hour before dinner"".

""A little lemon juice on the meats or after meals, may be indulged in at any time during the progress of the cure"".

zerocarb,"Looking to start the carnivore diet – do I have to do this 100%? Hi everyone,

Long story short I'm interested in doing the carnivore diet, but not 100%. I'd say that I'd like to follow the rules a majority of the time, but with some wiggle room to occasionally have carbs or something I'm technically not supposed to have. I know this prevents me from 100% of the benefits from this diet.

If hypothetically 60–80% of my diet is clean and carnivore, will I still get lots of the benefits from it? I know this is a zerocarb subreddit and I'm asking if it's alright to have some carbs in my diet (hence the newbie flair)! But, wondering if I can still get the advantages, even if not 100%.

Thanks!"

Is that as healthy as liver? I usually have bone marrow in some beef shank a couple times a month, is that too little/too much? Does heart count, or is it just a muscle? Brains, eyes?

zerocarb,"""The Carnivorous Diet"" published in The British Medical Journal on Feb 13, 1886 ""Sir, - On Friday, January 8th, I read the account of Dr. Salisbury's treatment in the Pall Mall Gazette, and determined to try the effect of it in my own case. Seven years ago, I weighed 11 st. 12 lbs. (height, 5 ft. 9 in.), and when I trained for my college-boat I always lost five pounds. A month ago, I weighed 14 st., so I was at least two stone above my weight. If any of my lean brethren wish to know how I felt, let them put on a top coat with two stone of shot stowed away in the pockets, and wear it for a single day. When my friends congratulated me on my aldermanic appearance, their compliments were as gall and wormwood to my soul. If they had felt as I did, that the hills of life were growing steeper, and that the pleasure of living was contracting in a daily narrowing circle, they would have condoled with instead of congratulated me.

For the last six weeks, I have lived on lean meat and hot water, or its equivalent, and yesterday I weighed 13 stone. I have taken a pint of hot water (130° Fahr.) at 7 A.M.; a pint of ""schoolroom-tea"" with a squeeze of lemon in it at 11.30 A.M.; the same at 3.30 or 4 P.M.; and a pint of hot water (130° Fahr.) at 10 P.M.; a pound of beefsteak at 8.30 A.M.; a pound and a quarter at 1.30 P.M.; and a pound at 6.30 A.M. This has been hot, but preferably cold, and has been varied with hare, chicken, etc.

The result is this. I am a stone less in weight; I am six inches less in girth; my gouty ""heirlooms,"" in the shape of ""hereditary deposits,"" have disappeared; my flatulent indigestion has vanished; my mental and bodily activity have doubled; I spoke on Thursday for an hour with less effort than I did in December for ten minutes; I sleep for seven hours without moving; I can wear gloves and shoes a size smaller; I have lost my tendency to catch cold; my muscles are daily hardening; my kidneys are doing their duty nobly; my figure is altering so rapidly that my tailor is in despair, but I am triumphant.

When I have completed the course, if you will spare me room, I will finish my tale, and relate the lessons I have learnt in dietetics and therapeutics during the experiment. - Yours faithfully, Ben Rhydding, Leeds. JOHN FLETCHER LITTLE.""

zerocarb,What’s with all the troll posts? Came out of nowhere was there some post that brought extra attention to r/zerocarb?
zerocarb,"2 Month Check In - One Happy Guy! I posted this as a comment in r/carnivore by accident but since I typed it all out, I figured I'd add it here as well.

 

Started on May 26th, so just over 2 months in. I've had a few cheat meals in there, maybe 3 or 4, like my birthday and the 4th of July.

I'm down 38 pounds (M, 6'2"", SW: 325, CW: 287). I have so much more energy for life in general. And that started early, like a week or two in, so it is not due to weight loss. I used to be gassy all the time, not any more. My libido is much improved as well as my stamina in bed. And my wife is much more willing since my stomach is so much flatter and I'm not farting all the time. Win-win. ;)

I can't believe the energy and willingness to just do stuff.  I feel 10 years younger, easy.  I actually weaned off coffee last month because I just didn't need it anymore after ten years of three cups a day.  

My back pain is gone. I had a herniated disc surgery two years ago, at the ripe old age of 37, no doubt due to my obesity and sedentary desk-job lifestyle. Occasionally, even after surgery, it would flare up. And I could never lie flat on my back for any length of time without experiencing pain. Maybe because a lot of my belly is gone, but I can now read on my back in bed and be comfortable doing it. I also just generally jump right up out of bed or a deep couch.  It doesn't have to be a big production.  I just get up.

The craziest thing I experienced was that, for literally the first time in my life, my body was telling my mind that it wanted exercise. Historically I have had to have a mental battle each and every time I wanted to lift weights or go for a walk or just take the damn trash out to the garage. This is hard to explain, but my body, not my mind, is just like ""move."" I started lifting weights 3x per week, walking 12,500 steps every day, playing tennis again, etc. And not because I am forcing myself. I just ""want to."" I can't explain in words how weird this is and how happy it makes me. I always wanted to be one of those people who said things like ""I'm miserable if I don't work out,"" etc. I was not. And now, while I'm happy resting as well, I really aim for that minimum hour of exercise each day.

As far as my plan goes, I generally eat twice a day. First meal is anywhere from 11 am to 3 pm depending on when I feel hungry. Second meal is almost always at 6/630 pm with my wife and 3 little monsters. I strive for 18 hours between meals, but will eat if hungry and won't if not.

I try to eat red meat for one meal of the day, either steak with as much fat as is attached, or two 1/3lb grass fed burger patties topped with a couple slices of cheddar cheese. This can be lunch or dinner. The other meal is whatever my family is eating for dinner unless we're having steak together. I make a protein and some veg and starch for the kids. I only eat the protein.  My wife isn't on board yet but she's going to start keto as a compromise.  Eventually I'll get the kids onto something similar, but it is summer and they have enough stress with CV-19 and not seeing friends, I'll save the dietary changes for a calmer time for them.

Tonight for example, we are having sous vide pork tenderloin with broccoli and rice. I'll only eat the pork and may supplement some butter or cheese since it is so lean. (By the way, if you don't have a sous vide, get one.  They are cheap now &lt;$100 and a complete game-changer).  Because I knew we were having pork for dinner I had two burger patties with cheese for lunch. I get these grass fed and finished patties at Costco for a reasonable price.

Occasionally I'll make a meal of salami, cheese and liver pate. I eat eggs and bacon at least once a week for my lunch. I like salmon roe from my days as a sushi eater (love ikura) and have that a few times a month. I eat chicken maybe once a week because the family likes it but I don't really look forward to it. I like shellfish and will do that a few times a month if given the chance. I like full fat Greek yogurt with cinnamon and will do that once a week or so.

As long as I eat from the animal kingdom, I have no issues. Happy that I can tolerate dairy. Once in a while if I eat a metric f\*ckton of fat in a single meal, especially after a 20+ hour fast, I will get diarrhea. But this has to be like a half pound of bacon in a 6-yolk omelet with a ton of cheddar cheese cooked in the bacon fat with some butter. Otherwise digestion is great.

Tl;dr: Everything is great. Feel great. Look great. Sleep great. Sex is great. Meat is great.

NEVER GOING BACK."

However when I eat beef (And I only eat very fatty cuts), I don't get the same effect, I feel a more mellow and less optimistic. I have the impression in this sub that most people favor beef, but I'm starting to consider if I should move pork as my main food source (right now it's about 60% beef, 20% pork, 20% chicken).

I've been on keto for two years before starting the carnivore diet one yar ago (3 years on low carbs). I've already had multiple gout attack before switching to keto (2-3 in one year, no medication taken, around 10 days of pure joy...). Nothing during keto, I've switched to carnivore diet in august 2019 and I've had a massive gout attack in february 2020 (1 leg 10 days and the other 10 days...). I've made a blood analysis in april 2020 and everything was perfect except my ferritine (410 ng/ml : ""should"" be under 274 dr said it was ok because the liver was ok ) and my uric acid (90 mg/l : ""should"" be under 72 )  and uricase (536µmol/l : ""should"" be under 428). My toes are always a little bit painfull, and when it starts I know it...

I eat beef and kidney or liver or brain (pork brain) and eggs everyday. Sometimes I eat raw dairy or nuts (every 15 days). Alcohol 3 to 4 times a year...

I've had another gout attack few days ago but this time I took colchicine and my dr gave me allopurinol. I don't understand why I'm having gout attacks as carnivore diet is supposed to regulate this (I didn't went on carnivore diet for this, but I've read lots of thinks about it), is it genetic, is anybody has had the same thing ? I'm really not fan of having to take a medication for life...

I'm 51, 1m78, 90kg.

zerocarb,"Why are electrolytes so important Once again I realized how important electrolytes are: just forgetting to take them makes everything so much harder even though I’m on a pretty strict carnivore. And just when I realized that and started taking them again I started to feel way more energetic, sleep and waking up got so much better, basically perfect again. But why is it so?

zerocarb,"Should I be concerned about eating pork steaks every day? Ideally, I'd eat grass fed NY strips and ribeyes every day, but with a 3rd child on the way that's not realistic.

I made a list of relatively low-cost carnivore foods, and a staple will be steak [pork shoulder from Fresh Thyme.](https://discover.freshthyme.com/product/318420/nae-pork-center-cut-steak-bone-in)

This will be accompanied by grass-fed ground beef, eggs, some bacon, salmon and some ground pork to go with my breakfast eggs.

Not ideal, but trying to be cost effective...but not at the cost of my health.

I've read conflicting evidence on the subject - should I be concerned consuming this daily?"

zerocarb,"Recipe: Fat trimmings It seems like a lot of people here have trouble cooking beef fat trimmings right, so I'll share what works for me.

- Preheat oven to 300°f.
- Cover baking sheet with aluminum foil.
- If you like them super crispy, cut them like bacon, but if you like them slightly juicy, cut them like thick bacon or thick french fries.
- Place them far apart on the baking sheet so they don't stick to each other.
  - Don't overcrowd the baking sheet or they'll come out soggy! Try to stay under 50% surface area coverage.
- Bake for 20-30 min depending on preference.

The reason I use this method is that it's consistent, the fat gets cooked all the way through, and the cleanup is easy (just toss the foil.)

Pics:

[High quality fat cooked for 20 min](https://i.imgur.com/hvYUL3P.jpg). Perfect.

[Low quality fat cooked for 30 min](https://i.imgur.com/fciA0Gj.jpg). A little overcooked but still very edible."

zerocarb,"Day 3 - Morning Anxiety is diminishing Day 3 of Carnivore. The first day I did have some cheese and Kefir, but I decided recently I really do want to eliminate all carbs. My feeding window has been between 10:00 AM and 3:30 PM. So far the diet (Outside of the day I had cheese and kefir) has consisted of Beef Bone Broth, 5 eggs, and and 1 pound of Ribeye/Strips seasoned with a large quantity of salt and pepper and cooked in beef tallow. Today I picked up some magnesium to supplement as well. Thoughts on magnesium supplementation?

My favorite side effect so far has been waking up with less anxiety. Does this continue to improve? I also recently quit marijuana, and I have zero urge to use it at the moment. Has anyone else had this experience?

Negative side effects so far have been what seem to be slight heart palpation and shortness of breath.

I am not able to do nearly as many pull ups as I could before, but I am sure my body will adapt. Regardless, the diminished morning anxiety has me very enthused about my future with this new way of living.

Sorry for the long post and many questions. Mainly wanted to report on being very happy with my morning anxiety fading away.

The idea that we need 8 glasses of water a day is absurd to me and doesn’t fit with the conceptual framework I have in my mind.

zerocarb,"Gum and teeth health, and maybe adaptation I've been eating carnivore very undisciplined off and on for the last year or so but I've been strictly doing it for the last 3 weeks.

My biggest issue is that meat will get caught between my teeth and hurt my gums and I've had to floss somewhat vigorously to get the bits out but it's been to the point that I've cut the gum between my teeth a couple times now. I've heard that people say their gum health improved, I'm just wondering how long it generally took to adapt because even with the softest cuts, unless I only do ground beef (which I don't want to), I still get pieces of meat that get caught in my teeth.

I'm also going to be investing in a water flosser as well but wanted to hear your guys' take. So yeah:
1) how long did it take for your gums to adapt? and
2) what kind of gum improvements did you see? Regrowth or..?"

zerocarb,"It's only my second week of coming back to strength training on zerocarb, and already I'm having great energy and endurance It's amazing. I didn't workout for a few months during the lockdown. Now after two weeks of strength training, I just did 18 sets of back and biceps never feeling exhausted or out of breath, just nice energy throughout the workout.

All my worries about zerocarb impairing strength training are gone. Before I turned carnivore, when I was starting strength training I'd feel terrible after each set, heart pumping out of my chest, as if it couldn't fully oxygenate my body.

Eventually after months of strength training my body would adapt, but the workouts never felt completely ""right"", now that I look back at it. So to have nice, energetic workouts after just 2 weeks is something incredible. (I went carnivore 2 months ago).

If you're doing strength training and wondering whether you should go zerocarb, I'd say totally go for it."

Are eggs/bacon/cheese ok to have in the first month?

I feel like hot sauce is a hard no but I still wanna ask.

I still have the occasional cup of coffee and some cheese but primarily eat bacon, beef, lamb, salmon, and chicken thighs. Pooping good, stable energy, and I'm not such a cranky little shit all the time.

The ONLY negative downside I have noticed is a profuse increase in the amount of sweating I do. Now, this is my first experience with biking in Texas heat as my primary source of locomotion but other people on SAD who are active don't seem to constantly look like they're taken a shower.

Another weird part is there no accompanying BO. Even when I forget my baking soda deodorant there's none to speak of. I just look and feel gross.

zerocarb,"Beef Marrow Bone Broth Method When making beef marrow bone broth, do you roast and eat the marrow before simmering the marrow bones for 24 hours, or do you roast and leave the marrow in and simmer? I’m wondering if leaving in is key or leads to overly gelatinous broth. Thanks for sharing your tips.

Update: I roasted and ate the marrow from the bones first, and then did a 24 hour slow simmer with the marrow bones and a few bones from ribeyes that I had saved and frozen. ACV and salt added. The broth came out well - it’s lightly colored and has a strong layer of gelatin on top. I would mix in more diversity of bones along with the marrow bones. When I make chicken broth I use the whole carcass and it comes out amazing after 12 hours of simmering."
zerocarb,"How do you decide when to eat? Even though I've been going for 5 months now, this is the biggest problem for me. I read that we're not to restrict our eating and to eat when hungry but what do you perceive as hunger? 

Back when I did intermittent fasting and got rid of carbs I got to remember that true hunger was felt in the guts and not in the head. 

I also read that we are trying to persuade our bodies that there is no shortage of food so at the moment I grab a steak every time I get 'head' hungry. Head hungry for me is when I feel like 'I could eat' and that's when I'd used to grab a bag of carbs from the cupboard. But If I ignored that feeling and waited for gut hunger then I'd be RESTRICTING myself from eating which I feel is frowned upon.

So at the moment I wait until my head is hungry then I eat till I don't want to eat any more. So far though, I have not settled on a regular time of the day which is inconvenient and eating to late in the day messes with my sleep."

Shawn Baker and Mahsa Rostami are organizing this fundraiser.

* Created 1 day ago
* [Education &amp; Learning](https://www.gofundme.com/discover/education-fundraiser)

Many of you have seen profound positive effects by the Carnivore diet. Incredible life changing health transformation from a broad spectrum of chronic disease are being seen on a daily basis.  While these impressive anecdotes are truly inspiring, widespread acceptance of this intervention is far from universal.  In fact, due to a lack of peer reviewed clinical data, this powerful tool remains relegated to mere curiosity and is met with extreme skepticism.  We’d like to change that, but we need your help to make it happen!

Support us as we move the carnivore diet beyond anecdote to hard clinical data**.**  We are embarking upon the first large scale modern clinical intervention trial on this remarkable dietary and lifestyle strategy.  Your valuable support will ultimately affect millions of lives and dramatically alter our understanding of nutrition and how we manage chronic disease.  This is a much needed step in further bringing this powerful intervention to the masses and the impact will be tremendous!

The size and scope of the clinical trial will be dictated in large part by our budget and thus the following tiered goals are being projected.  We anticipate a 6 month long study with either a single arm vs historical controls or a randomized control group pending funding.

$200K- We can do a smaller sized study with limited number of participants and limited outcome measurements

$500K-This level of funding allows for a far greater number of participants and a greater number of outcomes that we can assess.

$1 Million- This level of funding allows us to do a very high level Randomized Control Trial of good size with robust outcome measures.

Obviously, we’d like to do the highest quality and most impactful study that we can.  Many of you have seen dramatic changes in your on health using this method and we are asking for your help in legitimizing and bringing it to the masses.

Thank you

I am a male in his early thirties dealing with some erectile difficulties. May have been partially damaged one night and didn't recover properly from it all as there is reduced sensation. Mondor's or Peyronies is also possible, though I have seen multiple doctors and they say nothing is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had an experience where getting on this diet helped whatever erectile problems that they had before or if it improved in any way. I would be worried about fat clogging those tiny little veins down there and causing some problems but perhaps it doesn't quite work that way when you are eating only meat and not meat with carbs. If it took some getting used to and then you saw improvement later on. Very interested to hear peoples thoughts on this one. Thanks."

So ive been zero carbing for 6 weeks now coming off of a low fat vegan diet that almost killed me (no joke).

70/30 ground beef, ribeye, salt to taste, water (and magnesium supp)

I was wondering if too much fat is my issue here, because im still bloated below my belly button and always feeling full in my lower colon, also my stools are VERY fat and oily and they burn if they come out

The weird thing is though, i never had diarrhea from transitioning from 10gr fat a day to now 200gr fat a day. And im always reading that people who have issues with fat also always have diarrhea.

Still, i suspect the issue is too much fat its just weird because my stools are not that soft. So i was just wondering if someone encountered this as well

And by work I mean I see some improvements but im still very fatigued and have not been able to go to college and live my life. I have been on carnivore several times, but all of them I have cheated and given it up, so thats on me. This time I will stick with and ride it out. My question is if anyone have similar problems and have seen results. I really don’t want to take the medication because of all the side effects it potentially have. Is there a chance I can get off it in the future?"

I want to be a carnivore. For anxiety, depression, potential arthritis, inflammation, weight loss and for more energy.

I tried going carnivore before but quit due to side effects. 

Do you know what I need to consume to avoid these side effects? I did research. I'm guessing I need some electrolytes. But I can't figure out which ones exactly.

1. Very high heart rate

2. Lightheaded and dizzy if I'm standing up (very slowly gets better but still mostly there)

3. Heavily breathing very quickly after movement

All of them felt serious to me. I'm saying this as someone who walked half a mile with a broken foot.

- I sweat A LOT (This is NOT related to carnivore or my fitness, this has been always the case).

- I am far from fit.

- In my previous attempts to become carnivore I mostly consumed protein. Perhaps that was relevant to the problems I experienced.

zerocarb,Guess I'm carnivore for life now I started out zero carb on March 1 just to see what the hype was about and that lead to me jumping deep into the rabbit hole of nutritional. I just had my first real cheat meal yesterday. I regret it immensely. My body feels horrible and I could barely sleep last night. Zero carb carnivore has trapped me for life. I can’t go back to eating “normal food” after everything I’ve read and how my body feels after eating it. That sounds like a scary statement but it’s a testament to how good I’ve felt the last few months on this diet. Has the zero carb diet effected anyone else this way?

zerocarb,"Rugby and weight loss Adding small amounts of carbs

Hi all. Iv been doing zero carb since jan 1st and lost 60lbs, all anxiety and all sugar cravings. I did this with only 20 minutes of exercise a day. I ate steak fat trimmings eggs and liver.

Last week rugby pre season started up which means 3 extra hours a week of high intensity exercise! I am still 20% bf but do not want to drop weight as quickly as my position in rugby requires some good weight and strength (second row). 

I am thinking of adding maybe some potatoes and rice before and after training to slow down the weight loss a bit and not sacrifice muscle. More body recomp than weight loss.

My question is if you think adding these carbs around training could have any catastrophic effects (I.e rapid fat gain) given how sensitive I must be to carbs at this point or if it is worth the trial to see how my body reacts?

Sorry for the length and many thanks for any help!"

zerocarb,"Butter, bone broth, cramps and reactions So I've been carnivore for about two months now (more or less) to cure IBS/SIBO and I was doing just fine, feeling excellent everyday. Then some time ago, to get more fat, I tried reintroducing butter and I started to get a little mindfog, some bloating and then some skin problems started appearing, so I stopped and then everything went back to normal.

Some three days ago I tried drinking bone broth, no flavour, just made in 48h with bones and ""a little bit of vinegar to extract the nutrients from the bone"". After that, on the other day I woke up feeling horrible and had the most painful cramp in my left calf that I've ever had, had more bloating, had pain in my joints (completely new to me) and today it's like there's something in one of my eyes but there isn't, so there's this annoying feeling and I had diarrhea.

Has anyone ever had reactions like this on this diet? Also to bone broth and butter? (or maybe just vinegar)

zerocarb,"The vegetarian myth This has been one of the most eye opening, well researched, and important books I’ve read in my entire life.  I would say it has even changed my worldview.  

I know it is linked in the “about” section, but I just wanted to really highlight what an amazing read it is and encourage ALL OF YOU to pick it up.  There is a PDF version linked in the about section, but I’m sure when you’re finished there, you will want to buy a copy and support the author and read it and refer to it again.  

It really underlines how industrial agriculture, not grass fed ruminants, is the driving force for complete ecological destruction and is to blame for the decline in human health.  So many arguments I have read (and used to believe) from vegans are completely eviscerated.  

The kicker here is that the author is a decades long former vegan whose health declined to such a poor state...and consuming animal products brought her back from the brink.  Fascinating stuff.  

I literally cried reading it a couple times.  Do yourself a favor and read it.  You’ll probably look at the world, human history, and your food differently.

zerocarb,"So I married a doctor, and he is very concerned about my health on ZC! Heart disease, stroke, oh my! We got into quite a disagreement with this topic as the basis of it for several hours today. It came down to, ""It's hard to see someone I love hurt themselves by eating such a way"". At the moment I'm going for a strict 90 days, so I pose the question: ""Do you really think I will die in 90 days if I eat this way?"" ... and the response, ""I don't know"".

We threw articles back and forth at each other. Why cholesterol is or isn't important, LDL, triglycerides... how too much fat is good/bad. It goes on and on. When I make the point that, I've never felt better, digested better, slept better, or had more energy, he says, ""Yes, but who knows what's going on inside your body!?"" I would get a blood test, but of course, I lost health insurance as a direct result of Covid-19, and do not want to spend 300+$ (likely way more for an expanded panel) on a blood test with no insurance.

I made arguments about the pharmaceutical/health industry, and how there is often a conflict of interest about those who want to make money off the sickness of others. This annoys him (of course), because he is a doctor, and everything I say basically spits in the face of what he has learned.

Seeing as this is my husband, it is very important that we have at least some middle ground. I showed him multiple studies from the sidebar already, and he does not like ""anecdotal reports"". Most of the research on this is \*new\*, I know, but is there anything recent that offers commanding evidence that this WoE is overall better for health? I know it does not help everyone, but it has certainly helped me.

Also this is more a personal problem, but it will be hard if he cannot get used to the way it is - makes me sad :(. Any other support or stories from faithful ZC members?"

I need some help determining what is causing this. I did a three day fast because of some benefits I read about for eczema, and after I broke the fast with only beef I've been having diarrhea everytime no fail. I know fasting seems to be frowned upon but I felt I needed to mention that this happened. 

I've been eating the same cuts of meat I usually do for the past 80 days, and I never had this problem beforehand. Does anyone have any similar experiences or know what might be going on? I read something about the gastrocolic effect. I've also read about drinking water with meals might be the culprit, so I didnt drink water an hour before or after and still had diarrhea after trying this just 30 minutes after my meal.

If it helps to know, the first 2 months or so I was eating mostly meat, and small amounts of cheese and sometimes eggs. a couple days before my fast I started eating only beef, and this is typically ribeyes, brisket, ground beef, sirloin. Any advice on how to stop the watery movements? It doesnt give me any pain I just dont like having diarrhea."

zerocarb,"Zero carb with Bile Acid Malabsorption due to Crohn’s disease Hi everyone,

This is a very specific problem that I now realize most likely compromised my previous attempts to go clean carnivore (first time: 1 month / second time: 3 months) and I’m interested if other people here with similar backgrounds have overcome this issue or if knowledgeable people can comment on the feasibility of this way of eating under my circumstances.
Long post with background story and current situation incoming. Also hints at savage porcelain vandalism at times. You’ve been warned ;-)

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease not too long ago  which mainly targets the lower part of my small intestine (the ileum). Through trial &amp; error we found out that the sudden, debilitating diarrhea I’m experiencing constantly must exist due to an inability of the inflamed and scarred part of my intestine to reabsorb the bile acid before it reaches the colon. 
When bile ends up in the colon, shit goes down. Literally.
Now that I take medication (Cholestyramine) that binds the bile and renders it harmless for the colon, my diarrhea is virtually nonexistent anymore.

Now where is the link to zc?
I’ve tried to go zc twice in the past but had to stop each time as the diarrhea was substantially worse even after 3 months (with no progress whatsoever).
I could literally not leave the house without having a toilet nearby that I could reach within 3-5 minutes at all times. To illustrate the severity of the urgency: If you ever had a colonoscopy or had to take strong laxatives for something else, I would experience this kind of urgency 24/7 and out of the blue.
Now, I’m quite certain that this was due to the complete absence of fiber (as fiber binds some of the bile too) as well as the high amount of fat which in turn triggered more bile secretion and hence more bile ended up in the colon. This means that we are not talking about an adjustment problem here!

On the other hand, apart from the big D part, all my other symptoms went away and after reintroducing non-zc food I was far more tolerant towards stuff I couldn’t eat previously. This leads me to the conclusion that even in that relatively short period of zc a substantial amount of intestinal healing took place.

That’s the reason why I would like to give this woe another shot longer term to see whether the scarred parts of my intestine can heal over time and take up their intended functions again (so that I can be medication free at some point). My GI deems it impossible. I’m not as convinced.
But as the bile acid binding medication renders the bile useless in fat absorption, I fear that I won’t be able to digest enough fat to satisfy my energy needs (which are at about 3000-3500kcal/day to not loose weight).

The question now is: Are there people out there with a similar background that could make zc work nonetheless (maybe even had success in healing parts of their intestine)? And if yes, how?
Or do the knowledgeable folks out here have a theoretical idea on how to make it work given the (in my mind worst possible) preconditions for a high fat diet?

Thank you all in advance for lending me your brain power and experience!"

Well if I eat a lb of steak I am almost to the total for the day of protein and even with a couple tablespoons of butter I’m way below my fat percentages, not to mention my calories are really low unless I add in a lot of some form of fat, If I ate anywhere near 2 lbs of meat I would have way to much protein to fat.

zerocarb,"Day 13 of carnivore Diet with Extreme Fatigue (not in ketosis) Hi Everyone

Ive been eating carnivore (beef, eggs, bacon, cheese, cream) for the month of July and about 5-6 days in I started getting very fatigued. It has persisted throughout that time until now (day 13). 

I decided I wanted to check if I was in ketosis or not, as maybe my body hadn't transitioned to using fat as fuel yet, hence the extreme fatigue. To my surprise, I tested negative on the ketostix.

Most of the resources I've read said that I should already be in ketosis by now. Granted I was pigging out on junk food (carbs) before starting this way of eating, so possible I am still depleting my glocygen stores?

zerocarb,"Re-introducing Potentially Problematic Foods I've been eating just muscle and fat for a while now and believe I've come as close to a baseline as I can at this time. I'd like to start introducing foods I haven't had in a while -- namely chicken egg yolks and beef liver -- and was wondering if there are better or worse ways to add them back into my diet as an experiment. I may have reacted negatively in the past to both yolks and liver (though I'm not sure if it was due to them or something else), so I'm wary of re-introducing them.

A few questions:

How much to start with in one sitting? Taper up amount slowly or just eat same amount each day? Eat it every day or infrequently?

How should I time it with meals? Break fast with the new food, wait a bit and then eat regular meal? Eat it at beginning, middle or end of the regular meal?

How much, or long, of a chance should I give my body to adapt if I get a slightly to moderately negative reaction? A few days? A week? Two weeks? How long is long enough without a negative reaction to consider the new food not harmful? 

Lastly, after deciding whether a new food is working for me or not, how long should I wait until trying a different new food? Should I go back to original baseline diet for a while (if so, how long?) before trying a different new food?

Lots of questions. I'd be grateful for any tips, advice or experiences any of you might like to share.

zerocarb,"Meat plumping I just happened to be eating chicken breasts for the last three days, due to no other options in my location. They were typical unnaturally big, supermarket chicken breasts as you could expect. Something in the taste and texture was not right - they were unnaturally salty. So I started researching on the internet and came across some articles about so called „meat plumping”, which is injecting the meat with so called „broth” that usually contains salt, water and an antimicrobial (but sometimes other things as well). They usually apply it to chicken, but they inject beef and pork, too. Obviously I am pissed off about it and I will try to avoid supermarket chicken as much as I can, but do any of you have further information about what else can be added - especially sugar or sweeteners. I don’t eat salt, so naturally I don’t welcome any added saline brine in my food, but if I found out they also add some other enhancers or what’s worse, sweeteners - I’d have to really reconsider the meat that I buy and switch to mostly buying whole, pasture raised animals. I know sometimes they add potassium instead of salt, sometimes they inject plain water to increase the weight - which still sucks, but is more „okay” I guess.

2) I eat about half a pound of ground beef along with 2 oz of liver, and then whatever else I have lying around that I feel like.   I’d say that I’m significantly below the 2lb recommendation.   Probably an average of 1.25 lbs or so...
3) I believe that when losing weight is a goal, the zero or low carb will encourage the body to consume it’s own fat for nutrition.
4) I weigh myself every day on a Nokia+ (Withings Scale) — my weight has stayed the same for 7 days, but my fat % has dropped from 28 to 23.5%, and my muscle mass has increased by 5 lbs.   (I know these scales are not 100% accurate, but can at least see a pattern) — I however don’t believe someone can put on 5lbs of muscle in 1 week!   This is why I’m mostly puzzled

zerocarb,"Butter and egg consumption How many grams of butter and how many eggs do you typically consume daily, include tallow if you regularly consume it, just curious as i have found myself consuming a lot of butter on my steaks, and a significant amount of eggs as i find that the longer i continue the WOE eggs just keep tasying better."
zerocarb,"Gaining fat:protein ratio Sorry for my English, it’s not my native language. Hope you will get me right and believe that you know how to help me. 

I am switching from keto to carnivore. I want to try strict carnivore(meat, salt, water) to eliminate all plants, dairy, eggs, pork etc and then return them back one by one. The reason is to understand whether something is bringing my mental health extremely down. 

As far as I understand the average fat:protein ratio should be 2:1 (in grams). The beef that is available in my area is around 1:1. I still can’t find fattier meat, untrimmed pieces. The only thing I found is beef fat. I am making a tallow atm. 

So the question is how can I achieve such an amount of fat? 
I am 183cm high and 70kg man. So I need to eat around 70g of protein and 180 of fat. If meat gives me 1:1 that means, that I have to eat around 100 additional grams of fat. How is that possible on strict carnivore? 
p.s. I didn’t try beef tallow yet, but I think it is impossible to consume 100g of that. Is that healthy to eat rendered fat(homemade tallow) just with a spoon?

Please help me to understand where I can gain fat. Thanks"

I have one question for you - I was explaining the whole carnivore lifestyle + environmental issues (holistic grazing, methan etc) to my grandma today.

Does anyone know anything about this topic? Is there acid rain somehow involved?

zerocarb,"Negative thoughts and mental illness I've had depression and anxiety for most of my life and one thing I noticed before the carnivore diet because I was trying to meditate daily was that negative thoughts kept popping up no matter how much I tried to think positively. The funny thing is, they weren't even important, it was just bad things that happened in the past and don't make sense for me today, influence absolutely nothing now.

Then just one week into the carnivore diet, all of my depression and anxiety were gone and with them, all of those negative thoughts that kept popping up. Isn't that weird?

I know some people think that mental illness is just weakness, but I think that maybe every psychological illness has a link to physiological changes in the body. How could the frequency of something so abstract like ""negative thoughts"" decrease because of a change in diet? Isn't that interesting?"

zerocarb,"***One month update** If you are new.. if you are on the fence.. this post is FOR YOU.

All results are NOT equal, keep in mind. However..

I am absolutely convinced after one month of zero carbs...... Carbs and sugar are EVIL. Like literally from Hell 😂

My cognitive functions are running on high, I remember things better, faster and more vividly.

I have lost weight even on the days I haven’t worked out.

My PALETTE IS CHANGED FOREVER.

LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN

I have not wanted or even THOUGHT about ANYTHING SWEET!!!!

And before.. even with intermittent fasting there was this urge to say,”well ok I can eat this pizza or this honey bun.. bc I’m in a deficit..”

That’s just not how you’re going to train your body to become efficient and lean.

It’s ALL BEHAVIORAL. When you can eat whenever or whatever (on zero carb) your entire relationship with food changes.

I’m not counting calories are macros..

You figure what you can eat, what you can’t and you get creative 

I have never ever been more in tune with WHEN I need to eat. One day I wasn’t even hungry, worked out... played ball and performed at a high level.. didn’t even get hungry until the evening. It was like a fast on accident! The body was taking from my fat storage!

And all I crave is water! Haven’t wanted a soda or anything. Not even a Gatorade zero.

My skin has always been clear but now it’s crazy healthy and has a shine..and my hair is growing like crazy 

Just had to check-in and say I’ve never felt this good about my health.. from a psychological standpoint and understanding what’s going on.

Keep at it! ✌🏾"

zerocarb,"Why does ZC /carnivore diet make your thoughts clearer?

After 1-2 months, I still can't quite believe that it actually works, I feel exactly how others claimed and I enjoy a much clearer mind which allows me to focus for long periods of time... exactly as was predicted.

I'm curious about the actual scientific explanation behind this, could anybody point me towards some resources or share some theories? What is the causal chain? Is it down to the meat consumption or lack of carbs etc. ? I randomly read somewhere that ketones make your brain work better but there was no info to back that claim up. Could  it simply be that the sugar cravings took up a lot of brain capacity? Thanks for helping out a curious carnivore :)"

zerocarb,"""The Philosophy of the Stomach; or an Exclusively Animal Diet is the Most Wholesome and Fit for Man"" - by Bernard Moncriff (1856) I have recently come across a vintage book that caught my attention. It was published by a German writer, Bernard Moncriff, in 1856 in London. The author supposedly experienced remarkable health benefits on an exclusively animal diet and even conducted a few dietary experiments. He also attempted to bring attention of the contemporary scientific community and general public to this diet as being superior to the mixed and vegetarian ones. In his opinion, humans could and should live exclusively on an animal diet.

Below are some of the highlights I made while reading it that you may find interesting:

""I cannot help looking upon much of what has been written about the stomach and digestion with a similar smile to that of modern astronomers when perusing astrological works"".

""I like the sweetness of milk better than that of sugar, and the acidity of meat better than that of fruits"".

""Among all beverages I like milk best, hence I take no other fluid but milk. Of all eatables I like meat best, I eat, therefore, of it in preference to anything else"".

""Wholesomeness, was, and is my principal motive in adhering to an exclusively animal diet"".

""I do not eat for the mere sake of gratifying my palate, but to satisfy my appetite, I cease eating when I have had enough. But with your condiments, drugs, and drinks, you cannot say when you have had enough"".

""Leave the appetite sole master to determine the hours and frequency of the meals, as well as the quantity of food. I now make most frequently only two meals of meat daily, while I take a glass of milk whenever I please. As a rule, however, I take nothing in the last two hours before going to bed, which greatly contributes to the uninterrupted soundness of sleep"".

""The most wholesome diet is that which requires the least quantity of matter to be introduced into the digestive cavity for the support of the system"".

""The quantity of animal food required for the full support of the system is so much smaller, as to constitute a very considerable diminution of blood flowing into the heart and the lungs, - I hope to see it generally admitted that the strength of men would be much increased by their adoption of my diet. I myself have experienced a considerable increase of the strength of my body, especially as far as locomotion is concerned. I run over the same distance in nearly the third part of the time it took me formerly"".

""Plain butcher's meat, from a roast joint, is more than six times as nutritive as potatoes, and more than seven times as nutritive than wheaten bread"".

""It has also been found, not alone as a matter of general personal experience, but by direct experiment, that animal food is more digestible than vegetable food"".

""Men had better abstain altogether from fruits and everything else unfavorable to the teeth or the stomach. Fruits, it would appear, are destined in the economy of nature for birds, which are destitute of teeth, and the bill of which is constructed exactly of that substance Professor Valentin would have our teeth made of. All vegetables are, in my opinion, fit only for animals, which in their turn are to serve as food for man"".

""There will be a time when the entire human race will live upon an exclusively animal diet"".

""An exclusively animal diet, on the contrary, is capable of being adopted by the entire human race, and in all corners of the globe, under the burning sun of Africa as well as the Arctic regions"".

""Children brought up with an exclusively animal diet, and made conscious of the great advantages of such diet, would stand proof against the temptations of pot-houses as well as of divans"".

""The matter introduced into my stomach daily is not much more than the third part of that previous to my change of diet, my appetite is much better satisfied, and my body stronger than formerly"".

""Meat is the food which does the least, if any injury to the teeth, either mechanically or chemically. Not to speak of vegetable fibers and grains by which the teeth of the vegetarian animals are being worn away, even mealy and pulpy vegetables, as bread and potatoes, are acting in the same direction, though to a less degree, by their attrition"".

""An exclusively animal diet is unique, simple, and harmonious in its character, although the articles may be derived from animals of various orders. Because there is less chemical difference between the flesh of an elephant and that of a chicken, or a salmon, then there often exists between the potatoes of one and the same field"".

“My face, from being rather shallow, became clear and youthful, my eyes serene and mirrors of happiness. It gave me unknown, or rather, forgotten pleasure, to jump over ditch and hedge, and to make those exercises which required muscular strength”.

""I have not felt the slightest disagreeableness arising from the bowels, either in the shape of eructations from the stomach, or obstruction, or dysentery, or of any denomination whatever. Indeed, it if was not from memory, and from books, I should not know that I had such things as a stomach and intestines. The evacuation of the bowels takes place with ease and regularity once every other day. The quantity of both urine and feces is, as might be expected, much less than formerly. My nasal secretion has also very much diminished; and my throat and mouth being perfectly clean, I have no occasion to spit"".

""My nasal secretion has, together with the other secretions, greatly diminished, especially since I replaced a quantity of milk by meat"".

""It is extremely probable that my bladder, liver, stomach, and the rest of the intestinal canal have gradually decreased in size, which is the case with every animal changing a vegetable for a carnivorous diet. So, for instance the tadpole, which lives upon vegetables, possesses an extremely long digestive tube; but in its perfect state, and when its appetite has become altogether carnivorous, the intestines become very much shortened, losing four-fifths of the length"".

""The mouth of man has not been made to kill the prey, but to eat its flesh, for which purpose the teeth, tongue, and the whole gustatory apparatus, are admirably adapted"".

""The mere form of the human teeth matters very little in a dietetical point of view. Knife and fork will outmatch the most formidable cutting teeth of any lion or any antediluvian monster"".

""The stomach, however, does not tax the articles by their marketable price, but by their weight, digestibility, and other chemical and mechanical properties. There is no such thing as neutrality in our system. Everything that enters it must do something - either good or bad"".

""For six days consecutively I took, instead of meat, two pounds and a quarter of baked potatoes daily, without salt or any other ingredient. My appetite was not at all as well satisfied as with the three-quarters of a pound of meat, and I felt also a greater thirst to quench, for which I was obliged to take more than two pounds weight of water, besides the usual quantity of milk"".

""I made a similar experiment with home-made wheaten bread, free from salt and other ingredients, for eight days continually. I took two pounds and a half of bread instead of meat, without my appetite being satisfied, while the thirst was still greater than was the case with respect to the potatoes so as to oblige me taking, besides the milk, more than two pounds and a half of water"".

""Of omnivorous animals it has also been observed, that they preferred animal to vegetable food"".

""The teeth of carnivorous animals in a state of nature have not been seen to be decayed, what is always the case with those of vegetable eaters. The dog, which is often subject to toothache, has probably to thank this to the corruption his natural diet is undergoing in the domesticated state"".

""The domesticated cat, which lives on a mixed diet, has its intestines two-fifths longer than the wild cat"".

""While colds and pulmonary diseases are common among cattle, they are rarely, if at all to be met with among carnivorous animals"".

""I may assert without fear of contradiction, that all dead animal matter introduced somehow or other into the digestive cavity of every animal, without an exception, is being converted into living matter of the same animal"".

""Some plants live upon some other plants, but no plant can convert every other vegetable matter into its own living matter, and the mutual convertibility is entirely wanting. I presume, therefore, that the unlimited mutual convertibility is a single character, sufficient to mark the line between the two kingdoms; it being present in the animal, and absent from the vegetable kingdom. It is this chemical similarity and mutual convertibility which gives to an exclusively animal diet the character of singleness, simplicity, and harmony"".

""The great superiority of strength of the carnivorous over the vegetarian animals is due to this double ration, namely, the greater development of the lungs, and the smaller size of the abdominal contents"".

""The first repulsive effects of most condiments, liquors, tea, coffee, and etc, are quite forgotten by most people, these articles being, unfortunately, introduced into the diet of children of all classes. Yet it is frequently to be observed of children, not yet quite habituated differently, that they reject, when left to their own choice, everything salt, sour, bitter, and hot"".

""The popular notion is still in vogue, according to which every eatable and drinkable thing, either in a state of nature or manufactured, is to be presumed as wholesome and fit for man, until the contrary be proven. This notion is based upon another popular notion, that everything has been made to suit man. The truth, however, is, that man, though entitled to eat, or use otherwise, everything he can take hold of, meets with a comparatively very small number of vegetables that suit him well"".

""I have been very scrupulous to observe the rule, not to take of anything but as much as my stomach can easily digest, and to use those things only which agree with me"".

""A sound appetite ought not to be restrained, such appetite being the indication of the wants of the system, which must be satisfied to the full"".

""A perfectly healthy man could have only one appetite, and this a sound one, while the false appetite could only exist with imperfect health"".

""Man should have been furnished with a sense of taste so perverted as to make him like those things best which are the least wholesome for him"".

""Brutes spurn whatever is hurtful to them, and distinguish poisonous plants from salutary by natural instinct; and that they eat only of noxious plants when pressed by extreme hunger"".

""Men had better eat to live, than live to eat"".

zerocarb,"Recent intolerance to chicken I've been eating zerocarb for 11 months now and have recently developed an intolerance to chicken. I have had 3 bouts of digestive distress(and general inflammation) in the past 4 months which I am now certain were a reaction to eating chicken. All 3 occasions were drumsticks from the same supplier and always well cooked. 

This all started after taking a break from eating chicken for a couple of months. Before that it was something I ate at least once a week without issue. It also happened around the same time as a bird flu outbreak, here and in neighbouring countries where large amounts of stock had to be culled. I'm not saying this has anything to do with the issue and is most likely a coincidence, but looking back, the timing fits.

I don't think I have any issues with histamine as I regularly eat eggs, bacon, mature cheese, minced beef, and yoghurt without problems. I'd love to get back to eating chicken, but don't feel to keen on experimenting with other cuts or suppliers due to the nature of the side effects.

zerocarb,"What are the long term risks of an all (lean) meat diet? Hello Everyone,

I’ve (30M) been doing a zero carb diet for 5 weeks now and I am well past a lot of the usual problems with this diet. Such as bathroom irregularities...

In 5 weeks I have gone from (5’10”) 225lbs to 197lbs. In this time I have been doing one meal a day, which is roughly a 1/2 pound of grilled chicken at 12:00pm. It’s important to note that I don’t get cravings or feel hungry until 12:00pm. I have been supplementing fiber and multivitamins because I air on the side of caution. I have also made it a point to drink 64 ounces of water per day minimum (32 ounces in the morning and 32 at night) plus whatever I drink during the day.

I can’t even list all the benefits I’ve noticed from this diet: incredible energy, 8 full hours of sleep per night, great/happy mood and most importantly I feel full! Previously I was getting 4 hours a night of sleep, always lethargic and down right depressed.

As it stands I can’t see any downside to what I’m doing which makes me nervous. I see all the talk about “make sure you eat fats and bacon” and I really am not interested. I have had a slow metabolism my whole life and have been overweight for as long as I can remember. I really can’t believe how amazing I feel. I think I found a diet that works for my body type but I’m worried about what long term damage I may cause by continuing to eat this way.

My energy levels are getting back to normal, but I'm still experiencing really intense periods of high body temperature.

For some odd reason, my alcohol tolerance has gone up??  On keto, I would drink 2 and be a bit drunk/buzzed for a few hours at least.  But 3 had me buzzed for maybe an hour before it went away.

5% Kidney
50% Lean Meat

I eat a kg of the above mix per day so that means ~50g of spleen, liver, kidney, and heart.

zerocarb,"Carni-bread recipe!!! Not sure if I am the first to discover this or not, but I created an amazing dairy free carnivore bread I’d like to share with you all!!  If you have any intolerances to pork rinds or eggs, I would avoid this recipe.

Ingredients:

4oz pork rinds

Salt

2 Eggs

Instructions:

Pre heat oven to 400 degrees

Put 4oz of pork rinds into a freezer bag, and crunch them up with your hands until ground into a breading consistency (doesn’t have to be perfect)

Put pork rinds into a bowl, and add 2 whole eggs and mix

Mix until the egg is well incorporated into the pork rinds, and add salt to taste (I added about 2 tsp)

let it sit for about 10 minutes (this will allow the pork rinds to absorb the egg and soften up).

Put mixture into a baking pan (with sides for excess liquid!!!) and bake at 400 for 3-4 minutes

Drain the excess liquid, and let the bread sit for a few minutes to cool

Done!!!

I added hand shredded chicken and bacon to mine and used homemade bacon grease mayo as the sauce.  It was like a carnivore pizza!!"
zerocarb,"Please help with trimmings and sleep Hi, so I've been doing this carnivore diet thing for about 18 months now, with occasional days where I fall of the wagon. 

I'm having the following two issues -

1)eating relatively late seems to inhibit sleep, especially after training. 

Like every time I eat diner after training, or almost, I have trouble getting more than 3 hours of sleep that night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not eating diner does seem to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

2) trimmings cause my gut to knot up. I've posted a bit about this  before, but basically mentally I do best on super high fat - like 2:1 or 3:1 grams of fat to protein. Now generally the way to get this would be trimmings. Tallow is rather expensive/annoying to make because I live in a ghetto 15m2 studio under the roofs and it's 30deg Celcius outside (so if I have crockpot going all day my room gets so hot not even the devil can stand it). 

However, for the past like year or so I've had trouble digesting them. I've tried frozen, not frozen, raw, cooked in crock pot, cooked in pan, salted, no salt. Almost without fail, roughly 2-4 hours after I eat trimmings, I will experience my gut knotting up. The area around my stomach gets tight and it starts to pull my spine out of alignment. 

To give a better description - imagine that my skin is like a Tshirt. When I eat trimmings, a knot appears in this tshirt pulling everything out of whack. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen one person on here post about similar issues. Has anyone found a solution?

And if you eat trimmings without issues, could you please describe how? 

what type of meat you eat, how you store it, how you cook it, how much and how often you eat, anything else you thing may be relevant?

Thank you :)"
zerocarb,"Phinney on pemmican and high fat and zero carb diets Rediscovered this interview with Stephen Phinney which I'd seen around the time it came out. 10 years ago! (😳) 

It's a great podcast (there is a full transcript at link as well) 

"" The other thing that’s been said about pemmican is that the Natives always put dried berries in pemmican.  But the best, longest lasting pemmican was made in the late fall, or early winter, when berries were not readily available.  It stands to reason that berries were put in pemmican to please the European customers who were buying it from them.  So they would stick in some of the things the Europeans wanted to make it taste less austere, like berries and oatmeal.  However, for the natives, the reason why pemmican was made free of vegetable matter was to facilitate long-term storage.  If you made it right, you could store it for a year, or up to five years.  Which means these people could carry, with 100 pounds of food and ten people in their party, they could carry enough food to get through a couple of weeks with no hunting at all. ""

I've seen people wonder what they are supposed to do with all the extra grease after cooking burgers, but I generally just like to eat it with the burger fresh.

zerocarb,"Indoor Air Fryer vs Indoor Infrared Grill Cooking Question I'm looking to mix it up a bit with cooking. I'm trying to decide between buying an air fryer (Phillips Airfryer), an infrared griller (Phillips Smoke-less Indoor Grill), or a Ninja 5 in 1 grill. I have never owned any of these devices. I currently use my oven or a sous vide Cinder grill to cook my meats. The Cinder had a big footprint, is inconvenient to sear, takes a long time to cook, and is heavy as hell. Cooking on an oven just sucks.

I prefer my steaks, beef patties, etc to be blue rare to medium rare depending on my mood. I want smokeless (or at least a minimal as possible) and ease of clean up. Overall convenience is very important to me. I'm not a cook nor do I enjoy cooking. Maintaining the nutritional value of a meat (by not overcooking) is more important to me than taste, but I prefer both.

zerocarb,"When did Cognitive Performance Optimize for you? I've been strict carnivore since 6/12 so nearly 3 weeks. Before that, I was mostly going in and out of keto.. Probably not ideal but was doing 2-3 weeks of animal based keto (so still eating 30-40 carbs daily with active lifestyle) then a week of what would be considered healthy eating in America.. Fruit, sweet potato, some veggies.. but still kept the staples of carnivore in my diet through those periods (bone broth, raw liver, kidney, grass fed beef, wild salmon).

Anyways, at about 2 weeks into this strict zero-carb, I've notice a cognitive decline. It's not massive but definitely effects my creative, critical and logical thinking. I'm pretty sure the lack of insulin reaction is to blame but can't be sure. other times this has happened on carnivore in the past, I noticed that honey helped.. but then my Lyme symptoms inevitably creep out. So it begs the question, when did you strict non honey, non dairy consuming carnivores peak your cognitive function on this diet? Did you ever or did you just settle with the slight under-performance for the relief you felt in other areas?

I definitely consume enough salt, fat and protein. I feel amazing on my morning 1-2k swims.. Body feels like when I was a kid but this is the first time on carnivore that I've really focused on avoiding inflammatory meats and taking in enough healthy fat, broth, and organ meat. I've been exclusively eating raw suet, bone broth, and small amounts of raw beef liver &amp; kidney almost daily.. Then local GF ground beef or wild salmon every day, raw beef heart twice a week, local quality raised chicken skin in air fryer as a treat 1-2 times a week. I only salt my food then include some rosemary and Thyme from the garden. I have been cooking my ground beef on the more done side lately which probably doesn't do me any favors. I just want to hear some anecdotes. Perhaps they'll encourage me cuz if I still feel a bit less snappy in the brain by 6 weeks, I might give in to a weekly dose of honey. But definitely won't if I know there's light at the end of the tunnel with what I'm currently doing.

&amp;#x200B;

\*EDIT\*: READ IF EXPERIENCING BRAIN FOG: Thank you for all the awesome responses. I delt with lesser cognitive function for a few days before this posted. I upped my suet intake the last few days and lessened my protein by a tad which seemed to be the culprit. Make sure you're getting enough fat.. Quality fat ideally. Raw suet is incredibly easy and cheap to come by from local farms and pretty tasteless for those of you still adapting your palate. If you can't handle, toss it in a cup of bone broth and gulp or ground beef.

Also possible that my body hits an adaptation phase at 14-21ish days considering that's always been when I've felt inclined to carb cycle based on physical and cognitive performance. 

Another factor that doesn't pertain to the scenario in my post but may relate to many of you dealing with this: Dairy, no matter the quality (I was buying local raw grass-fed goat milk and goat cheese) gives me brain fog and ruins my carnivore experience. It was the leading factor in my stopping multiple times until I pinpointed the cause. 

I also see many anecdotes in this sub where people eat 3 pounds of high protein meat in a sitting. If you're like me and don't do much muscle resistance training (I'm a swimmer, that's about it), that high protein may cause you brain fog. It does for me. Lastly, while not terrible, eggs give me brain fog.. and when I was purchasing eggs, they were strictly from a secluded local supply with a giant field and tons of grazing. They weren't soy and corn free but as close as I could get without breaking the bank. 

Lastly, as someone else mentioned here and couldn't be closer to the truth.. Don't forget other heavily contributing factors. The obvious ones that some underestimate like sufficient sleep, sufficient sun exposure/vit D, exercise, hydration (huge one for me, I need more water than most), and grass fed, source vetted organ meats.

I'm a 21 female and I've been an ex-vegan for about a month, been vegan for almost 3 years, stopped because my health was crap and I've finally made ""the connection"" between my restrictive diet and my poor health. I was so exhausted all the time, no matter the amount of sleep I was getting, I was weak, dizzy when I standed up (and passed out a couple of times, probably aneamia), heart palpitations every day, depressed mood, terrible migraines that would last for days or even weeks and of course digestive issues (heartburn everyday, constipation or diarrhea). And finally skin issues : eczema, extremely dry skin all over my body, some acne (not extreme but still) and above all rosacea. I've had kinda red cheeks / nose since I was a teenager but the awful burning and itching and bright red skin during flushing appeared while I was vegan, never had that before. 

So I first started eating eggs, then fish, then meat. I did a lot of research and decided to cut out grains (I've already become gluten free during my veganism as I was desperate to get better), at this point I was eating animal foods (except dairy) + all kinds of vegetables. I felt better and was amazed to see that my skin was getting a lot better, less red, more clear, almost no more rosacea flushing. But I still felt bloated and gassy after every meal, digestion was painful.

I kept researching and stumbled upon carnivore diet which seemed crazy at first but I saw it was beneficial with people with autoimmune issues (which runs in my family) so I decided to give it a try. It's been a little more than a week since I've been a strict carnivore. Before that about one week carnivorish (I was eating berries and honey). Now I mainly eat grass-fed beef (I try to get some fatty meat, mainly groundbeef but also steak and cheaper cuts that I cook for a long time), some eggs and canned sardines, also ate beef liver like twice, had some bone broth twice. I salt my food liberally and take a magnesium supplement.

The good : almost entirely stopped feeling bloated, gassy and tired after meals. (few problems digestion wise but I'm adapting). Feel less frequently dizzy.

The bad : my rosacea who had started to get better when I reintroduced meat is acting up almost daily ! I don't get it since this diet is supposed to be anti-inflammatory. I even cut out chicken, pork, and butter/ghee because I thought it might inflame my body but so far no changes... I'm kinda desperate because I was hoping to heal my skin with this diet, which is sooooo important for my self confidence and well-being. And I saw testimony of women who saw huge improvements on their rosacea with this diet. I'm kinda tempted to stop it, but I know it's just the beginning and I should try to stick around for minimum a month. But it would be easier if I just didn't have any improvement, not getting worse ! Which I honestly struggle to comprehend because meat seems to be so much easier on my digestion.

I think I'm going through some kind of ""keto flu"" ? I also had a couple of days of migraines even through it has almost entirely stopped with reintroducing meat.

So my questions are :  do you have any advice or explanation ? Do any of you experienced some condition getting worse before it got better on this diet ? How was your experience with skin issues, specifically rosacea ?

TLDR : ex-vegan started carnivore, symtoms of rosacea getting worse"
zerocarb,"Airfryer short review: one of the best appliances I've ever bought Hi all, just wanted to share this in case anyone's considering buying an airfryer. It. Is. Amazing.

Turn it on to preheat to 200°C in 3 minutes, during which I take out my beef and cut it into nice chewable pieces, put it in and wait 4-5 minutes. Depending on how rare I'm feeling that day.

Because of the air frying technique, all of the oil and water will stay in the container. It will simply condense instead of evaporate. This gives the meat an enormously rich flavour. I'm thinking of ways to describe it, but I'm kind of lost for words. It's like damp, but in the best kind of way. Quality is 10/10, and, in comparison, I'd now rate an iron cast as a 6 tops.

Hope I can help someone to just get up and get one!

P.s. I've got a princess model of about €60"

I thought to share this experience.

I have been taking ancestral supplements' beef brain for almost a month. As a result, I've experienced way more sound sleep than before. 
Then I switched to dr ron's beef brain since it looked cheaper, per pill cost wise. I started it couple of days back and today morning I didn't get the usual ""euphoria"" that I have been getting from a good sleep for the past 1 month.
Just wondering if anybody else experienced this.
I am also wondering if Ancestral supplements is adding melatonin or some other substance to its brain product to ""spike"" the results.

zerocarb,"Sick/Flu Symptoms After Exercise - Can Carnivore Help? I've had this problem for a long time. I am guessing it's some kind of autoimmune response (excessive inflammation). At first it only happened after really strenuous workouts, but eventually it happened after every workout. Later, it started happening even after small exertions like walking to the grocery store.

Symptoms? Swollen lymph nodes, feeling like my body is burning up from within (feverish), clogged nostrils, pain in various body parts, depressive and anxious mood. The heavier the exertion, the worse the symptoms will be. It does not help to ""push through"" those symptoms, as they will only get worse if doing so.

These symptoms usually show up between 1 hour and 12 hours after exerting energy.

I was wondering if anyone else has noticed a similar thing and if you were able to remedy it using the carnivore diet. I just started light exercise again after being sedentary for 5 years. I am able to do 1-2 sets of an exercise every day, but if I go above that I seem to get symptoms. I hope to be able to slowly work myself back into good shape. I have been on the carnivore diet for 4 months, and it has helped a little but I am obviously not healed yet."

Study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC16602/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC16602/)

TLDR:

""For these five Neanderthal specimens, therefore, we have stable isotope data indicating that geographically and chronologically dispersed Neanderthals consistently behaved as top-level carnivores.""

""Therefore, the emerging picture of the European Neanderthal diet indicates that although physiologically they were presumably omnivores, they behaved as carnivores, with animal protein being the main source of dietary protein. This finding is in agreement with the indirect archaeological evidence and strongly points to the Neanderthals having been active predators."""

-High choline content
-impressive fatty acid profile 
-Source of B vitamins 
-High in selenium and other minerals

I’m sure I’m missing a few, but the egg yolk is basically nature’s multivitamin. I find it hard to be lacking in any micronutrient if adding liver and egg yolk. They also make a great sauce for meat.

Shame, because it is supposed to be so nutritious and rich in Vitamins, and lion and birds of prey often eat it first.

I bought the calf liver at a upscale butchery, washed it and fried it thoroughly the next day. Added salt and pepper. The moment I bit on it, I got this very strong revulsion, and had to spit it out. I recently had liver sausage from wild boar (15% liver), which I loved.

zerocarb,"3 Questions to Go All In  I've been a lurker on this sub for a while, and gained a lot of insight. I saw a comment awhile back that got me thinking. It was in response to someone mentioning they stuck with this way of eating ""for the most part."" The response was essentially, ""Which 3 questions do you need answered to commit 100%?"" So, here we are.

I've tried this way of eating once before, a couple months ago. I eased into it and I stuck with it about 90%. I got through the, ahem, *unpleasant* changes in bodily functions the first week or two, and acclimated well enough that any amount of carbs had me running...I had also gotten to the point where I was in a better mindset about not wanting/craving other foods. I can't really say it made me feel 100 times better, but I definitely noticed a difference in my overall well-being. Yes, I understand it takes more than a month or two to realize the full potential of this WOE. So, with all that out of the way, here are my questions, with other sub questions to hopefully convey what I'm aiming for.

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do you resist other foods?   
I love food in general. It’s not an unhealthy thing either, I just really love all sorts of food. I could eat soup, some good homemade bread, or even chow down on some salad. I love grilled veggies. Pizza is always on the menu. Just about anything with carbs is delicious. You see where I'm going with this...
2. How do you keep things fresh?  
I lucked out in that meat and dairy products are my favorite things to eat overall. I like just about any meat, but I don't really know how to explain this one. I don't know if it's a texture thing or what, but eventually I get to the point where I just get tired of eating purely meat and dairy. What do you do to curb this feeling? 
3. How do you manage eating this way with family?  
This isn't a ""they give me funny looks""/""they don't support me"" sort of question haha. My family has been nothing but supportive. Anyway...

My wife and I eat with our families at least once, often twice, sometimes 3 times a week, whether we are over there or they are here. Eventually we will have a family of our own, and I'm just curious what you guys do in these sorts of situations. Do you take prepared meals with you? There's usually meat involved in whatever we are eating, so that's not an issue. It's just everything else that goes with it. As far as eating with kids in the house, is it as simple as you eating just your food then everyone else getting the rest? I guess I'm just curious on how much of a struggle (or lack thereof) it is doing so.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I probably won't eat this way forever. However, I did enjoy it the first time I tried it and would like to stick with it longer and see where it leads. So, I'm trying to get all the advice I need to adhere to it better in the future. 

Thanks!"

zerocarb,"I don’t drink coffee, but should I start? My goals for this diet is weight loss and to help fix my inflammation (shoulder tendonitis).

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2dPdN\_60Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf2dPdN_60Y) 

His bottom line is that chicken and pork are poorly fed (grains) and this their fat is full of PUFA that is bad for us.  Ruminants don't have this problem so much, even when poorly fed, due to the way they digest food.  He even targets eggs from poorly fed chickens.

Thing is, properly fed chicken and pig is unavailable for all practical purposes.

I've heard similar stuff before, but not to this level.  For me, just eating beef is a bit too much.  I mostly eat beef, but dark meat chicken, ribs and pork belly add nice variety."

zerocarb,"The Diet For Anxiety? Hey there, been a lurker for a bit and decided to bite the brisket and start up. I apologize as I'm sure there's a similar post somewhere but reddit search is reddit search.. I'm going on a year of having fairly brutal anxiety that came up out of nowhere and I've been desperately doing everything I can to kill it off.

I've been doing carnivore now for bit over a week and a half and my anxiety has seemingly skyrocketed the past few days. For me, it's the constant feeling of shortness of breath, which is terrible. I came from a mostly keto background, and I was just curious if anyone else has gone into this diet for the sole purpose of defeating anxiety and has had similar issues. 

The first few days were great, but now this has really made me dread the day. I mainly eat red meat (preferably fatty cuts), keep up on my electrolytes, salt, exercise, etc. Pretty sure I've been doing pretty well as far as diet goes. Just looking for some advice or motivation going forward. Thank you so much for reading this shit pile.

zerocarb,"Antibiotics, Probiotics, Kefir, Gut Flora, etc. Hi all,

I'm currently on antibiotics (Amoxicillin Clavulanate) for what was a severely gnarly tooth infection.  I had the infected tooth extracted and I'm feeling so much better!  I will be off the antibiotics soon and was wondering if any of you fine folks want to brainstorm with me what the best course of action is for me to restore my gut flora post-antibiotics.

The way I'm leaning is actually to essentially do nothing; eat meat, drink water and let my gut recover/restore naturally.  The tooth infection got nasty enough that it caused some quite serious gut//digestion issues, which are now clearing up with the tooth removed and antibiotics in my system.  So, my gut microbiome has actually been messed up for awhile now because of this infection, so wiping things clean if you will via the antibiotics and letting things fall back into balance naturally with meat/water only instincively feels like the best course of action.

*However*, there is of course the nagging part of me that thinks/feels I should be more active about this, the antibiotics wiped out my gut flora and I should restore with either some probiotics supplements, kefir cheese (I used to make my own and have grains in my freezer) or both.  Thoughts?

Lastly, I wanted to ask if there is any more carnivorous way to go about this?  Isn't rotted ""high"" meat a thing and suppose to be good for gut flora?  Or perhaps getting a really good cut of steak and eating it raw?  Is that of benefit to the gut?

Thanks."
zerocarb,"Little improvement in eczema and rhinitis after two weeks and leg cramping. Hello everyone,

I have eczema and rhinitis and I want to see if I can improve these conditions.

I decided to restrict food down to beef, pork and lamb only. This involves a small amount of liver (100-200g a week), some home-made stock and pork skin (as crackling from roast joints). No tea, coffee etc. only water. Before this I was largely doing a keto diet but I wasn't strict all the time. I've been doing this for 15 days so far.

I was supplementing around 800mg potassium (citrate) and 200mg magnesium (glycinate) alongside added salt to begin with and I started getting a soreness in my legs. I've now increased the potassium to 1,200mg and added 800mg of calcium (citrate). The soreness is gone but two weeks into things I'm experiencing painful calf cramps during the night-time that wake me up. I experienced these before, when doing keto, but 800mg of potassium and 200mg of magnesium a day appeared to help and I didn't have this issue for a long time. I'm not sure if I should try upping any of the electrolytes again or if this is short term.

So far I'm less itchy than I was, especially with my scalp, but my dermatitis is no better than before and is slightly worse in fact. My rhinitis is not too different but perhaps slightly less severe. My symptoms wax and wane with no discernable pattern. How long do I realistically have to wait before deciding if there is no improvement? When I previously quit alcohol, a partial improvement in my eczema symptoms occurred very quickly and in less than two weeks.

The good news: I was experiencing some dandruff and scalp itchiness beforehand which has significantly improved which I imagine is due to decreased sebum. I have little to no bloating and my bowel movements are easy to pass. This reinforces my previous discovery that fibre does not benefit my bowel, as I have previously experimented with reduced fibre intake.

I've inadvertently lost about 5lbs in two weeks despite trying to eat a fair amount of meat (\~2-3lbs /d). It's a bit difficult to do so as meat is highly satiating and I can find it difficult to eat much fat at once. I'll try to eat more fat, though I suspect a lot of the weight loss is water weight considering the symptoms of electrolyte issues.

I decided to cut diary, poultry, fish and eggs in case those are implicated in my eczema or rhinitis. I was planning to add back fish to begin with after three to four weeks. Maybe I should do that sooner rather than later to see if I can increase my overall nutrient intake, avoiding more weight loss and maybe helping with the cramps. Perhaps the omega-3 in oily fish would benefit my eczema and rhinitis. I'll likely test fish for one week whilst noting any symptoms. After fish I want to try eggs.

I am having a small amount of vitamin C (\~60mg on most days) in pure powder form to be on the safe side. I don't think it hurts to have a small amount even if it's arguably not necessary.

So the questions I have:

* Do I need to optimise my electrolytes, and if so, how?
* Otherwise how can leg cramps (""charley horses"") be resolved?
* How long would it take to see an improvement in eczema or rhinitis?
* Would adding in fish earlier than planned be a good move?
* Are there any other concern nutrients? Folate for example?"
zerocarb,"Grass-fed vs Grain-fed organs Hey

I have a burning question about organs: 

Is there a big difference in the nutritional profile when we compare grass-fed vs grain-fed organs? Not only in protein/fat/omega ratios, but also other potential pollutants?

It is hard to find grass-fed heart, tongue or other organs besides liver in my area, but there are grain-fed ones. I'd like to give them a try, but since this diet is about eliminating shit that we don't need (toxins, pesticides, insecticides and other chemical compounds that cattle can possibly get from worse living conditions and grain-based food), is it worth to stick with what I have (grass fed beef mince, liver and different cuts) or is it okay to eat things like grain-fed beef heart?

zerocarb,"Zero-carb for Football (Soccer)? Three years ago I was playing football competitively but after a sudden turn of events, I had to stop playing due to an unforeseen stomach condition (IBS). Now... three years later and three months into the carnivore diet, I've lost over 2 stone (28lbs)!

I am now back down to the weight I was when I was playing my best football, but I am nowhere near as strong. I'm really happy with the weight I've lost and accepted the fact that there's more to lose to at least look like I used to, although I feel like one of those boxers who's dropped down a weight class too soon!

I'm a big fan of this WOE in terms of my general lifestyle, but I'm sceptical as to whether I could perform as well as I used to whilst eating this way. I'm wondering if this is just a temporary feeling or whether it will pass.

Does anyone have any experience playing a high-intensity sport like Football whilst on carnivore? Is a ketogenic diet more suited to the sport? Your honesty is most welcome.

zerocarb,"How to properly cook a steak on a stove top (with just butter)? What am I doing wrong? So, I’ll start with how I do it, and I guess give me tips to fix my errors!

1. Leave steak out for about 30 minutes, pat dry it, then season it. 
2. Preheat pan for about 5 minutes on medium-high. 
3. Throw in butter (it starts to brown and smoke immediately)
4. Put the steak in
5. Flip after 3 minutes
6. Add more butter, then baste (a ton of smoke comes during this step)
7. After 3 minutes, take the steak out

The steak comes out nice, medium rare just how I like it. 

But, I feel like I’m burning the sides, and there’s so much smoke that I must be doing it wrong. Everything online says to use olive oil then baste with butter, but I’m following strict carnivore (meat, salt, water, butter)"

zerocarb,"Dairy-free update 37F/ZC2yrs

So, I eliminated dairy on 6/1/20 to see if I could see some improvements in the final frontier of chronic rhinitis (stuff runny nose).  I am definitely seeing some decrease in severity and frequency, so I'm feeling really optimistic.  Secondary side effects: my historically insatiable hunger is waning.   I am leaner looking but my weight is up about 2lbs, which infuriates me.  However, clothes are more loose, so I'm hanging my hat on that.  I don't measure very often because I don't like the cold measuring tape to touch me and I'm fancy like that.   I probably still eat too much and by probably, I mean definitely.  I was NOT hungry for supper last night and I still ate some steak.  I've got some serious issues surrounding that.  I used to eat cheese as my ""dessert"", so now that I am no longer doing that in the evenings, I am sleeping a tiny bit better.

zerocarb,"Bone density/facial structure So I watch a few carnivore YouTube channels, and a couple of them have stated that people are commenting that their facial structure has changed. 

Now I’m not sure if I’m trying make a connection here, but my facial features are starting to look more defined. I was always lean, but I never had strong facial features. After 2-3 months on this WOE, my cheekbones seems more defined and my jawline looks more like it did in high school. Also, my jaw is certainly wider when I compare it to older pictures. 

I made a thread last week about putting on 25 pounds since starting this WOE. The reason I was shocked, was because I lost my last bit of flub near my bellybutton and my six pack came out more defined. As people mentioned, there was no way I put on 25 pounds of pure muscle, but I suspect I put on a good amount. This was confirmed after meeting up with a bunch of friends this week. 

One person on that thread suggested I probably got an increase in bone density from the amount of K2 I’m consuming. This would make sense. Has anyone had a similar experience where you’ve seen changes in your facial features? Also is there any type of test to quantify bone density?

* never drink water 1h before or after meals
* lower fat intake
* lower protein intake
* smaller meals
* vary salt intake and type 

One month ago it seemed I found a good equilibrium (since it gave me perfect stools for three weeks) with 80% lean meat and 20% added fat (so it would probably be 1:1 ? To be clear 80 grams of lean meat plus 20 grm of suet, and I make the butcher grind them together).

Since a couple week I can't seem to tolerate this mix anymore! This mean I am getting diarrhea. I have even tried this weekend a lower fat percentage (85gr lean 15 gr fat) and I still got digestion distress. This DID NOT happen with ribeye, brain or fish. I am baffled  by this phenomenon but I have two major theories:

1. The fat the butcher gave me was a slighlty different part of suet (very unlikely since I have already asked). Are you aware of differences between different parts of suet?
2. My tolerance for suet varied. This is for me the most probable one but I cannot explain it to me. Two weeks ago I digested it now I don’t?

I tried carnivore in order to address my autoimmune issues which started around 20 (ankylosing spondylitis and accompanying symptoms like brain fog) and the diet did effectively end that suffering as well as my anxiety and depression. 

So, at the age of 21, I no longer felt that burden of physiological depression for the first time in my life. I was no longer living in that mode of being anxious a d critical and what not, which was great, but I had learned how to exist and even live well and meaningfully like that. My suffering had built a lot of selflessness and humility in me. Then suddenly I felt carefree and actually looked forward to and was enticed by things. Feeling some excitement for life is great, but I feel like a different person almost. 

Has anyone else felt this sort of discomfort with learning how to feel more “normal” after transitioning to this diet/lifestyle? There have been a few occasions where I’ve broken from my diet for a couple of weeks, and during that time I feel pretty awful both physically and mentally, but I feel more myself too which is... odd?

It probably sounds sort of edgy/cringy, but I learned to exist in a certain state of suffering and now it feels uncomfortable to be out of it.

zerocarb,"How Much Food Is Enough? So this is my second day on ZC/Carnivore and I started my day with 4 scrambled eggs, 2 slices of bacon &amp; 2 slices of ham. When conversing with a more experienced Zero Carber, they said that I need wayyy more than that.

I was kinda shocked to be honest. I usually eat modest portions and been heavy on the greens. The thought of throwing more fat and even more bacon into my diet is still a bit contradictory in my mind.

So I want to ask, am I eating enough when I’m full? When I have adequate amount of fat? Combination of the 2?

Also can I have too much fat? Too much bacon? etc. is there a point where it becomes inimical to my health? 

Thanks"

I didn’t realize all my dreams had been emotional and *draining* and strenuous until they just stopped being so. It’s definitely happening again.... does this happen to anyone else? Their dreams just stop being bad? Why do you think that is? (I really wish I could pinpoint which food is causing it)"

zerocarb,"Intense cravings during my 'time of the month' I've been on carnivore for about 3/4 months now. I don't have periods due to the type of pill I'm on (progesterone only pill) but I still have hormonal changes. I get my usual back aches, slightly bad moods and intense carb/sugar cravings once a month during this time. (Granted, since being carnivore my mood is much better and my aches are less intense.)

It usually happens that for a whole week, all I can think about is the food that isn't carnivore. It's like I obsess over it. For the rest of the month I'm totally fine and I don't bat an eyelid at the carbs and it doesn't bother me. It's just this one week which feels like hell...

Does anyone else experience this?

 I've tried eating more fat during this time to possibly help the cravings (like eating bacon) but nothing seems to help.

If it helps to know, a usual day of eating of:

150g ground beef 21%fat with some beef liver
Chicken leg or thigh
2 eggs
Salmon/some form of fish

zerocarb,"Zero Carb 3 Months Huge Results! + * Let me give some background information before I talk about  my results.
* I'm almost 30, my heaviest weight ever was 425lbs. I was at 400lbs when I started this diet. I spent my entire life struggling with being overweight and thanks to an unfortunate hereditary trait I'm a super taster (I have more tastebuds on my tongue than normal people do). This resulted in me finding almost any and all vegetables super bitter and earthy and it made me sick.
* I was picked on viciously during school for being overweight and I tried to lose weight many times. Slimfast to exercise videos to starving myself. Nothing seemed to work for me. Everyone would tell me just to eat more vegetables and it was a miserable thing to hear because I couldn't stomach them.
* Around 2014 this new revolutionary diet comes out called the Mean Green Juice Diet. It involves putting several veggies and some fruit into a juicer and only drinking this juice. The guy promoting it lost a lot of weight. I gave it a try and was able to hold my nose and fight back vomiting and I had pretty good success. Unfortunately the results didn't last and I gained all the weight back very quickly.

**My Results on Zero Carb Diet.**

Around February 1st I was looking on Reddit for a diet. Keto looked promising, but it involved so much veggie intake that I knew it'd be impossible for me to maintain. I was extremely depressed and felt completely hopeless. Right before I closed my browser Reddit suggested me ZeroCarb subreddit and I clicked on it.

I had heard of the Zero Carb diet before, but I thought it was just a fad diet years back. Completely ignorant to what it was about. I started reading about it and it was completely based on meat only diet. Finally I had found a diet I could commit to and not hate myself in the process.

**1st Month:** I mostly ate Hamburgers and chicken. Within completing my first month I was down 20lbs. Everyone said listen you will lose a lot of weight, it's probably water weight, don't get discouraged if it doesn't continue. I was prepared to gain some weight back. Surprisingly I didn't. Mind you that I'm extremely obese though results definitely vary.

**2nd Month:** I started noticing I had way more energy. I was an extremely lethargic person and slept a lot. Mostly because of being overweight and depressed I thought. Suddenly I was able to stay awake for much longer and had seemingly endless energy. My mood got so much better and suddenly the world didn't seem so bleak. I added more variety to my diet like bacon, sausage, eggs, coffee, steak, ham and pepperoni. At this point I was down about 40lbs.

**3rd Month:** At the beginning of the third month I realized I was down 40lbs. I measured myself with a tailor measuring tape and realized I could wear 4XL shirts now. If you've never had to wear a 5XL shirt before it feels like you are draping a table cloth over yourself, it feels very humiliating. I went to the store and bought a 4XL shirt and sure enough it wasn't tight on my body. I was so happy to finally be able to wear a shirt that isn't excessively baggy and big.

Midway into the 3rd month I continued my diet and I started grilling meats outdoors. Everyone in my family had noticed dramatic changes in me physically and emotionally. I'm honestly happier now than I've been in probably the last 12 years of my life.

Towards the end of my 3rd month I clocked in my weight at 340lbs. Now I had reached this weight before on the Mean Green Juice Diet, but I quickly gained it all back within months. However the main difference between the Zero Carb diet and the Mean Green Juice diet (Besides Zero Carb actually working) is that the Zero Carb diet had reduced my shirt sizes. I measured myself and now I can fit into a 3XL shirt.

That is something I haven't been able to do since 2009. I was honestly just thinking that my 4XL shirts were just getting stretched or something, turns out I was ready for another size down. This diet has given me my hope back and made me feel so much better about myself emotionally and physically. I enjoy going out and walking now, it doesn't hurt to stand for more than 30 minutes anymore. My asthma has dramatically improved and I barely need my inhaler.

Listen, to anyone struggling with weight loss please consider giving this diet a try. I know diets feel like a curve-ball guarantee for disappointment, but this diet genuinely works. I'm not going to say that you'll lose tons of weight like I did because I was severely obese and in terrible health, but you will see results and feel so much better.

Thank you for reading and thank you all in this subreddit for posting tips and success stories. It truly helped keep me motivated to continue this diet."

zerocarb,"Gained 25 pounds in 2 months So before the quarantine, I was weight lifting 5-6 days a week. I was doing your standard keto diet with limited protein. I stand 5’9 and weighed 150 pounds. 

For a little context, I walked around at 180 when I was playing college football. Body fat always around 10-15%. 

So for the past three months, I have been doing strictly resistance band workouts. I took a vacation back home to my parents and was astounded when I stepped on the scale...I saw 175. 

What’s even stranger, is I now have a six pack again. So the majority of that weight was lean muscle. My brother in law is even considering the diet due to my shift in body composition. 

Another factor at play here is I now have more energy for my workouts. There are so many great benefits to this WOE."

zerocarb,"Meat consumption vs environment https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI

One of my favourite ted x talks, which I totally agree with. It’s about how to heal earth and reverse climate change with free grazing cattle.

Recently I’ve had an opportunity to observe massive poaching, ruthless overfishing as well as overpopulation. Due to the coronavirus I’m temporarly stuck (by choice) on a tropical island on the coast of Cambodia. Literally everyday I watch local divers collecting heavily protected giant clams or regular people hunting endangered spieces like huge monitor lizards, turtles, hornbills etc. - all protected by law. The level of corruption is so high here that nobody bats an eye - they do it openly. They put ads on internet about selling different wildlife, like baby Silver Langurs (near extinction), which are sometimes posted as screenshots in local expat groups. Most of this animals are being sold for big bucks to chinese people, who use them as afrodisiacs or as traditional medicine - for example they believe that one type of gecko cures HIV, seriously.

Older locals say that decades ago there used to be plenty of huge fish around each little pier. Right now sometimes there are barely any fish when I’m diving, and I live directly by the coral reef. The reason for that is commercial ships throwing their cages all around the island, catching fish with no respect to size, sex or breeding periods.

On top of that, due to poverty, there are local teens who swarm the rocky shores each evening to collect little crustacens, crabs, snails and cast nets to catch little fish. There are days when there is literally not a living thing left.

Asia is just an overly distinct example, but same thing happens all around the globe, especially in oceans. How could we solve this problems as humantity? I strongly believe we could supply much more meat by free grazing cattle on vast areas of unused land, as the guy in the ted x video claims. What about overfishing? Do you think natural resources can be more renewable? By regulating laws or using some better farming technologies?

Guilty as charged, I do a fair amount of fishing myself as well as seafood collecting while I’m here, but I believe it’s very hard to drain any resources by sourcing locally with respect to breeding cycles and releasing protected species back to the wild. Unless you are heavily exporting all the local wildlife to other countries, but that’s another story. My best friend is a chinese guy and he says there are almost no wild animals left in china. Sad to hear this, as those are some magnificients regions of the world with seriously stunning wildlife.

I think it’s a very good topic, also for repelling vegan bullshit. I post some FB photos of the fish and seafood that I catch sometimes and I have my vegan friends crying to me on messenger or expressing their discontent in comments. One guy asked how could I put such a pretty colourful fish on the grill, to which I replied that it’s a discrimination to claim only ugly animals have their place on the grill. I have my local hippie neighbour subtly trying to point out that I eat too much fish and asking me to let them go if he sees me catching some. This bullshit happenes more than I’d like it too and a big chunk of my generation is brainwashed by this vegan BS. I’m not the person to silently accept some delusional snowflakes moralising me so I’m always on the mission to confront them with truth.

Every informative content much appreciated, as well as good links to videos and articles about the subject.

By the way, if you want to see some of this colourful fish turnt into a carnivore meal, you can check my instagram profile, where I call myself „carnivoretraveller”. I have a collection of high quality lamb and beef photos from Iceland (plus whale meat and seal fat) and lots of wild game meat photos from Poland, too.

Hi I started the carnivore diet around 4 months ago, and like everyone else for the first few weeks I had poop problems, but everything went back to normal after 2-3 weeks. Last month I started peeing out of my butt every morning. I started to wake up every morning feeling lightheaded, and kinda dizzy for an hour or two, but the second after I wake up everyday I head to the bathroom and poop liquid.

Everyday I eat the same thing 2 meals a day. For lunch I have 4 eggs, 10 bacon strips, and a tablespoon of ghee(sometimes 2), for dinner I have around a 400 gram USDA Choice steak(sometimes I eat 500-700 grams if im hungry) every night with 1 table spoon of ghee. The only thing I noticed that was different in my diet was me switching from chicken liver(had it with my eggs, twice a week) to beef liver crisps(Carnivore Aurelius Beef Liver).

Therefore, I am now faced with the harsh truth of considering to get back on some immunesupressive drugs and combining that with this diet in order to hopefully get better results.

To me, this is sort of a big dissapointment. I totally get that this diet isn’t a cure for everything, and that everyones case is different. However, a lot of people have been able to reduce or totally get off medications with this WOE. Worth saying that since my diagnosis 2 years ago I have never come close to remission with medications or diet, so perhaps it not surprising in my case.

I was wondering if anyone have any experience or advice? Perhaps I can use biologicals to obtain remission and then get of them if I obtain a carnivore diet? Does anyone with autoimmune/IBD issues have any inputs?

I have been following a carnivore diet for three months while measuring my strength, stamina, productivity, and blood tests, before and after the diet, to provide accurate results and proper review. Will my carnivore diet experience be a success story or debunk the claims of carnivore advocates to prove the diet is unhealthy?

I started the carnivore diet because I wanted to lose fat and increase my cognitive output while retaining muscle mass. I am experiencing benefits form the carnivore diet but there are some side effects including severe muscle cramps

The most obvious carnivore diet benefit is weight loss, but my concern was that losing fat may come with the side effect of losing muscle. This video explains my results from before and after the carnivore diet, as well as my plans for the future"
zerocarb,"Lower fat ratios &amp; not eating fat with each meal What is your experience with lower fat ratios? I’ve noticed Shawn Baker (who is the best carnivore doctor IMO) started eating way leaner couple months ago - also if anyone knows his ratios please post in the comments. 

Couple days ago I noticed a drop in my personal fat cravings so I decided to weigh and count my food for 3 days in a row and it looks like I’m consuming 200-250g of pure fat with 1,5-2kg lean meat (300-400g pure protein). That equals around 60% of calories from fat and I feel good eating like this. 

What is your experience with lower ratios considering satiety, energy levels and digestion.

Also, do you eat fat with every meal? I myself am staying in a remote location and have acces only to lean protein + tallow, suet and lard separately. I usually eat my whole daily dose of fat in my big morning meal and sometimes have a second meal in the evening which is just lean fish."

I do this as from what I've read from different sources a 2:1 fat/protein ration is ideal. I've been wanting to get off the dairy for a while, but I can't figure where else to get the fat from without eating something that makes me gag. I tried bone marrow for the first time today and I found it to be very unpalatable!  Unfortunately supermarkets where I am butcher all the fat off of the  meat cuts so that's not an option (you'd be hard pushed to find any cut more than 15% fat) and my local butchers are closed.

I started the Carnivore diet 2 months ago to see if would cure my ""life ruining"" IBS-Constipation. Started from Keto, IM fasting. Since starting Carnivore I began feeling improvements in the first 3 days. Its been 2 months on Carnivore and I feel 10 years younger. My mind is clearer, my strength and endurance are returning to highschool levels, bowel movements improving, what bloating? anxiety vanishing, ect. Miracles.

I was 165lbs (74.8kg) starting this diet and began to loose fat and gain strength and size. Weight training and cardio on alternating days. I'm a little excited to gain all of my skills back so I end up playing basketball 5 hours a day sometimes.

As a Newbie slight skeptic I had to start somewhere, deciding to play it safe and follow Paul Saladino's Nose-to-tail diet. Sifting through the Forum, I see that a lot of OG Carnivore's don't feel this is necessary. 

Since I'm trying to fix my gut, I've cut out Dairy &amp; egg whites becuase I dont tolerate them well yet (Might try in the future). I do beef, some pork, egg yolks, sardines, Wild Salmon and beef fat.

Recently, I'm loosing weight and loosing SIZE and STRENGTH due to calorie needs doubling and having a hard time getting the calories in.

For Nerds like me

Typical Day
4 Egg yolks
2oz Beef liver          (56g)
10oz 75/25 Ground beef  (283g)
10oz Affordable Steak   (283g)
12oz Beef Fat           (340g)

Without posting macros and CICO, I'm short like 650 calories and eat 1.5g protein per lean lb mass.

zerocarb,"So I did this for a month to see if it was worth it. I promised myself that I would strictly adhere to the zero carb guidelines for the month of May and what a learning experience it was.

The most obvious benefit would be the 25 pounds I lost, the extra energy I have at work, and the fact that I don't limp anymore after being on my feet all day.

But that's not the exciting part. The exciting part is my relationship with food is practically perfect now. I don't eat for the sake of eating. I don't feel the need to snack and I can walk past junk food even if it still looks delicious to me.  I can't stress enough how BAD I was with eating junk until I felt sick, there's no way for me to overstate it. 

Bottom line is that this woe is the game changer I needed. No disrespect to Keto but I never felt THIS good on that diet. I know I've just begun but I have to say thanks to Dr. Shawn Baker for being a voice for this diet and all you beautiful people for providing more information and stories.

zerocarb,"What to prepare for flight? Taking a flight this Friday, leaving after lunch and landing late at night. Wanted to prepare some food to take with me to avoid spending ridiculous amounts at airports.

I don't particularly enjoy boiled eggs (think I have a problem with those cooked whites), do you have any suggestion?

Was thinking of just cooking some bacon or maybe ground beef in a casserole?"
zerocarb,"Nausea &amp; upset stomach I threw up last night. I felt mildly nauseous before but not as much as yesterday. 

Three possible reasons
1. I had way too much fat: had short ribs for lunch and they had a Lot of fat, too much that I could not finish the meal. It makes me nauseous to recall the meat even now. For dinner, I fried eggs and had a bit of chuck roast. When I had a bit of butter (that I fried the egg with), I almost threw up. I normally love butter. 
2. I had three cans of sparkling water (non flavored)
3. I had apple cider vinegar with sparkling water. I felt nausea from the ribs that I hoped acv might help. I might have had a bit too much...? I had about 4-5 tablespoons 

Do you think excessive fat was the reason? Or other reasons?"
zerocarb,"Mini rant about this diet Ok I'll start off by saying everything about this diet is perfect. I feel great I sleep better I'm lean as hell. High energy no inflammation. Everything is awesome. 

But.. what the fuck is with the no water around meals thing. I workout all day and get so thirsty but then if I drink I can't eat for a while or I'll get the runs. But I'm super thirsty! Nope too bad better wait. Ok fine but it's getting too late to eat so I better cook and start eating. Oh right I gotta salt my food or I'll feel kinda off from low sodium... NOW IM REALLY FUCKN THIRSTY!  too bad I gotta wait atleast 30 minutes. But now it's bed time and if I drink water I'll have to wake up in the middle of the night to pee. So basically I'm dehydrated all day.

When does this go away? Its driving me nuts. I gave in and had some water with my meal today and almost instantly my stomach is rumbling and bubbly - time to go to the bathroom. Help me out guys this is the only part that's getting to me. Diarrhea sucks and it makes me feel like I'm not digesting food if I drink water with it."
zerocarb,"Total elimination of heavy cream I don't necessarily over indulge. Through out the day I have two coffees each having two table spoons of heavy cream. Today I'm starting a strict programme of grounded meat, steak, eggs, water and coffee. This is the start of third week I'm eliminating cured meats and pork. 

Could this quantity of cream prevent or slow down results. Should I totally scrap it."
zerocarb,"Should I bulk, cut, or maintain on carnivore diet? Today is my first day of the carnivore diet. I've been hearing about tremendous weight loss from my friends (they're also cutting). I want to still be building muscle while dieting this way, but I also want to lose fat. Is maintaining the way to go here? Or would you reccomend bulking? Would love to hear your thoughts!"
zerocarb,No more itchiness from wool? So I used to get super itchy from wearing anything with wool for any extended period of time. Thing is I love the wool flannel my mom got me one Christmas. I'd wear it for short amounts of time before I would get uncomfortable and have to take it off. It's winter where I currently am and I haven't even gotten the slightest itch!!! Anyone experienced this?
zerocarb,"Ribeyes 😎 Felt like I wanted to quit BUT THEN I went to the butcher shop restocked on my meat collection and tried my very first Ribeye 😁👍❤️! It looked so small but really filled me up, looks can be deceiving 😏"
zerocarb,"OK so I'm new... Not only to this subreddit, but also to Reddit as a whole so I can only apologise for any naivety or rule breaking.

I started my carnivore journey yesterday and was hoping to get some opinions.

Yesterday I had:

Bfast: 5 eggs scrambled.
Lunch: 4 chicken thighs
Dinner: 300g or ribeye and 280g of fat free sirloin (had it in the freezer and wanted to use it up)

I've also had a couple of black coffees and a small glass of whole milk as a snack.

I feel fine minus the mild headaches which paracetamol seems to cure.

Just wanted to know if I'm on the right sort of path or not? I'm heading back to the butchers tomorrow to stock up. And whilst I appreciate ribeye is probably the best cut, probably can't afford it and will be getting fatty sirloin cuts."
zerocarb,"Bone broth vs bone marrow I don't understand the hype for bone broth, which you have to simmer for several hours, when you can just scoop out the marrow and eat it.

Or does something improve during the cooking process?

🤷‍♀️"
zerocarb,"Starting a Carnivore diet after Keto I've been doing lazy Keto and Intermittent Fasting for over one year now. I've been reading positive things about the Carnivore Diet, so I've decided to give it a try, starting tomorrow, after a 48 hours fast, and for 1 month. What are your best advices?"
zerocarb,"Healing but healing what I keep reading when your not eating your body is healing. What exactly is it healing? Any one copy a link of a paper or article to back this up. 

Ive just completed week 2. Definitely lost some fat can't say I feel great. I'm tired most of the time even with electrolyte and salt. Keto flu. I know it will pass. Looking forward to that good feeling I keep hearing will come."
zerocarb,"Coffee and double cream about 5 times a day, how bad is it really? I’ve tried giving up but it’s flippin hard. It just goes down so well especially after meals."
zerocarb,"How to cook liver? I've been carnivore for over 100 days and I think it's time to introduce liver in my diet, can you recommend a way to cook it? I remember eating it when I was a child and it didn't taste good, so I'm looking for recommendations to make it tasty. Thank you!"
zerocarb,"100% Grassfed Ground Beef vs Conventional Steaks I can get 100% GF ground beef for 6.39/LB.

What would be better for health and energy, GF Ground Beef or Conventional Steaks?"
zerocarb,"What to eat when not hungry? I don't know about you guys, but when I don't eat enough calories I get:

- Ringing in my left ear

- Slower brain

- Significantly worse at CS:GO

- Less motivated to do programming (my profession)

It takes around 18 hours of fasting for these symptoms appear.

What am I supposed to do in this situation?"
zerocarb,"Sun exposure and zerocarb I had been a carnivore for over 2 years now, and everything has been great so far. Recently, we've been enjoying many sunny days in England, so I've got a lounger and I've been sunbathing in my patio for 5 minutes at a time. But over the weekend I did it for a bit longer, then I felt a bit dizzy and sick. Thought it might be a heatstroke, but not sure.

What are people doing when taking the sun? Do you use sunscreen (I don't, there are some studies that say that they are carcinogenic - however, nowadays it looks like everything is)? For how long do you expose yourself to the sun? 

If you have any good articles, studies, etc on this subject please share. Thanks"
zerocarb,"Carnivory Conference 2020, originally scheduled for May 23, then moved to August, is now cancelled due to difficulties of organizing global high quality conference. Possibly an online event instead. I just received an email. 

Sunday, 2020-05-29

Dear Conference Supporters,

Even though there is a remote possibility that the Boulder Theater will be allowed to host a full conference by August 1st, we must acknowledge the overwhelming drawbacks to going forward now.

A third of our presenters reside outside the U.S. and may not be allowed to travel, or could face difficulties returning home.

Many among us are battling chronic conditions that increase vulnerability to COVID-19. A great number of tickets have already been refunded, some explicitly for this reason. Several people have contacted me to tell me they love CarnivoryCon, but simply cannot put themselves at increased risk right now. Nor would we want them to. While there are many good reasons to question social distancing policies, it is quite possible that holding the event at this time could endanger lives.

Wherever you stand on the state of evidence about the potential risk of large gatherings, the financial risk of hosting a poorly attended conference jeopardises the future of the event.

Some people have expressed desire for an online version. We are considering hosting an innovative, online carnivore event, but it would not be, and could not be, a replacement for CarnivoryCon. The Carnivore Conference prides itself not just on cutting edge presentations, but on an exceptionally high-caliber food experience, and an incomparable in-person social vibe. It is a disappointment not to be able to offer that this year, but we would rather invest our energies in next year’s meeting, than sink them into an event for which circumstances are so heavily stacked against it living up to its aims.

Sincerely,
L. Amber O’Hearn"
zerocarb,"Weight exact same. 3 months in. I am coming up on 3 months Carnivore, and today my weight is the exact same from the day I started. I’m glad it’s not up, but it’s a bit discouraging it’s not moving down as I have been pretty strict, not even having one bite of sugar this entire quarantine (which really has been miraculous since I’ve had no cravings). Just wondering if anyone can relate or share successes of weight starting to trend down at SOME point in this journey with little movement in the beginning months."
zerocarb,"How much is ‘enough’? I thought I was eating enough. I was having a pound of beef and a few eggs on most days. Usually twice a day. Did not feel hungry but still craved snacks like cheese and cream and pork rinds. I am 5’2” and 120 pounds and have restricted calories for the last twenty years.  I was happy to eat meat (I love meat!) and I thought I was eating “enough” for I wasn’t feeling hungry. 

Now after a month on ZC, I am beginning to question whether I was really eating “enough”. If there is a gap between “not being hungry” and “eating to satiety”. Maybe I was scared to overeat and still had unconscious aversion to fat that may lead to initial gain. Yesterday I really wasn’t hungry but still ate sliced chuck roast for dinner, taking Eleanorina’s advice. This morning I woke up hungry! i had two slices of bacon and four eggs fried. 

Maybe I should now try two pounds a day and see. Also I will not restrict to two meals a day but eat when hungry . Does this apply to petite women like me? These days I don’t want to eat eggs as much as I did at first (I ate as much as 6-7 eggs then. Now they don’t taste as good and I just don’t want them as much-today breakfast was an exception.)"
zerocarb,"Question about gas grilling burgers and liver. Hey guys, Would it make more sense to grill lower fat burgers like a 85-15 since you’ll loose most of the fat in the grill? 

Second I found some beef liver frozen at smart and final, could I grill that too or should I cook that in a cast iron with butter? 

(I’m using first street burgers from smart and final)"
zerocarb,Starting Zero Carb/Carnivore.. Some help? So I’ve been doing keto for 4 months now I’m fat adapted and I love it. I’ve found out about Zero Carb/Carnivore and thought it was a more strict version of keto so I decided to give it a try. I’m going to start tomorrow for 30 days minimum. If it works well for me I’ll do the rest of the summer and see from there. I’ve just got some questions. How many pounds of meat should I be eating per day? Do you guys take electrolytes or minerals? I’m a 23 yo man with 33% bf and weigh 193 but I want to drop to 180 while building muscle training to lower my bf would this be possible to build strength or muscle while losing some weight at the same time? And I live in the US I can’t afford grass fed organic meat so is it fine if I do the supermarket meat for now until I start working again?
zerocarb,"How long until the mental benefits hit you? This is my second bout with Zerocarb. Only a week in so I’m not wondering why it hasn’t hit yet, I understand it may take few weeks at the least to really benefit/adapt.

I’m just looking for some knowledge as to when the alleviation of depression/ anxiety and other mental benefits come in for the average carnivore."
zerocarb,"Attending PKD Seminar, does anyone have experience with Paleomedicina or PKD? I am considering attending a 5-day seminar with the Paleomedicina team later this fall. The stay includes blood work, different tests and specific advice for the individual. They will explain how the diet works and how to follow it, and they will assist you with follow up appointments later on.

I am aware that a lot of their work is available online and that the essence of the diet is a 2:1 fat to protein ratio and including organ meats, along with some other adjustments. However, I have been suffering from ulcerative colitis and have not been able to manage it with normal carnivore or medications. Therefore I thought this is worth giving a go and see if it can help. Perhaps the testing can reveal something.

Does anyone have experience working with the paleomedicina team or doing a Paleo Ketogenic Diet? 

Thank you."
zerocarb,"What's your favorite way to prepare hamburger patties? I like to mix 1 pound of hamburger with 3 egg yolks. Make four patties and salt and pepper each side. Cook in frying pan and top with colby jack cheese. Eat with a little A1 Steak Sauce.

After the hamburgers are cooked and resting on a plate, I pour the 3 egg whites into the same pan. The whites soak up all the juice and seasoning leftover from the hamburger patties. 

How do you prepare your hamburger patties?"
zerocarb,"Where to start? I am interested in starting this diet. I have a few questions. Firstly, how expensive is this? could someone give me a comparison in the price of this diet and a ""normal"" diet? I think I would like to continue eating eggs, cheese, and the occasional tall glass of whole milk along with meat. What kind of meat should I eat mostly? I don't see many posts of people eating chicken, it seems like it's mostly beef. Also, should I expect robust diarrhea?

Thank you guys in advance and God bless you hearty meat-folk!"
zerocarb,Should you chew the egg yolk when drinking raw eggs? Today i tried raw eggs for the first time theyre not that bad its only the egg yolk thats thick in my throat so im conaidering if i should drink the whole raw egg or chew on the egg yolk
zerocarb,"Calfs always twitch/ early morning cramp Calcium? Started about 2 weeks ago, i've tried  added sodium/ potassium nada, can it be calcium? Ive only been doing meat.. very little butter and zero cheese/ milk on month 4 now. Also do magnesium 400mg daily,eat 2 Lb red meat  3 gram sodium 2.5 gram potassium. Ive done added electrolytes as well up to 5 gram salt 3 gram potassium.

zerocarb,We All Should Be Proud! I am getting close to two months of Zerocarb &amp; Carnivore diet and I feel amazing for my discipline and being able to follow a WOE that is truly beneficial for me. We should recognize how hard this WOE can be and should be extremely proud of how far we are coming and going. Just wanna say proud of all you for choosing your health as a priority! 💪🏽
